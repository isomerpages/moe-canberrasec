<br>The afternoon began with eager anticipation as we gathered for a pre-show
dialogue with the acclaimed director, Huzir Sulaiman, whose insights illuminated
the narrative's nuances, thematic richness and a peek behind the curtain
about staging a theatrical production. As the curtains rose and the melodies
filled the air, we were transported into a world where the struggles and
triumphs of adolescence unfolded before our eyes.</p>

<br>Through poignant lyrics, catchy melodies, and expressive dance movies,
the musical resonated deeply with each member of our cohort, evoking a
tapestry of emotions ranging from nostalgia to hope. We saw ourselves reflected
in the struggles and triumphs of the characters, finding solace in the
shared journey of growth and self-discovery.
<br>
<br>As we reflect on our own parallel experiences, we are reminded of the
profound impact that art can have in fostering empathy, understanding,
and connection. The musical served as a poignant reminder that our efforts
and relationships, though sometimes unnoticed, hold immeasurable value
and deserve recognition in a society that often measures success through
narrow metrics.</p>
