<h4><strong>Fostering Gratitude: Primary School Teachers Honored Through Student Messages</strong></h4>
<p>At Canberra Secondary School, our students took a meaningful step to recognize
those who shaped their educational journey. In celebration of this year's
Teacher's Day, our Secondary 1 and 2 students took a moment to reflect
on their journey and express gratitude to the teachers who shaped their
early years. As part of the Gratitude Card activity, they wrote heartfelt
messages to their primary school teachers, thanking them for their dedication,
guidance, and support. This gesture of appreciation allowed our students
to reconnect with their roots and honor those who played a significant
role in their development.</p>
<p>This activity was complemented by a beautiful sunflower paper quilling
artwork created by two Secondary 1 students from class 1 Honour, symbolizing
the essence of gratitude. The vibrant sunflower, crafted with intricate
paper quilling, represents how our minds grow when nurtured with appreciation,
encouragement, and love. Just as a flower needs sunlight to bloom, our
minds thrive when supported by positivity. The quote, <em>"The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love,"</em> reminds
us of how gratitude helps us and others flourish.</p>

<p>At Canberra Secondary School, this idea aligns with our values of <strong>gratitude, respect, and compassion</strong>.
By showing gratitude, we recognize the efforts of others, just as the sunflower
blossoms with care. Respect allows us to value each other's contributions,
fostering a positive environment where everyone can thrive. Compassion
helps us support and uplift one another, ensuring that all students feel
encouraged and valued, much like a flower that flourishes with nurturing.
Through these values, our students grow into thoughtful, engaged learners
and compassionate leaders.</p>
<p>These heartfelt messages were personally delivered to the various primary
schools in our neighborhood, strengthening the bonds between our educational
communities and spreading the spirit of gratitude beyond our school walls.</p>
