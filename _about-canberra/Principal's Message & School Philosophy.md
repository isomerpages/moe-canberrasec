<p>I am filled with immense pride and excitement as we embark on another
chapter of our shared journey at Canberra Secondary School. This year,
we embark on a bold new chapter guided by the theme “Envisioning 2030 –
Charting &amp; Setting Directions for the Next Lap”. Together, we aim to
nurture Future-Ready Canberrans who are global-minded, resilient, and equipped
to thrive in a dynamic world.</p>
<p>At Canberra, our vision is clear: Nurturing Future-Ready Canberrans. Our
mission, Growing Minds, Glowing Hearts, and core values of Gratitude, Respect,
and Compassion remain steadfast as the foundation of our educational community.
These principles drive our efforts to ensure every student is prepared
not only academically but also as a valued creator, connector, and contributor
to society.</p>
<p>In line with this vision, our strategic focus this year is anchored in
three key areas that will guide our efforts to shape a dynamic and future-ready
school environment. The first area of focus is Developing a Rigorous Curriculum,
where our aim is to nurture Grateful Creators through cognitive excellence
and mastery of nine essential digital competencies. These competencies
are crucial for equipping our students to thrive in a rapidly evolving
world shaped by technological advancements, ensuring they are well-prepared
to face future challenges.</p>
<p>The second focus is Enhancing the Co-Curriculum, which centers on fostering
Respectful Connectors and Compassionate Contributors. By building character
and leadership excellence through a holistic co-curricular experience,
we are committed to helping our students grow not only intellectually but
also as empathetic, socially responsible individuals who can positively
impact their communities. Finally, we are committed to Empowering Staff
Capacity and Capabilities. Our dedicated educators play a pivotal role
in this transformative journey. Through initiatives such as the Teacher
Growth Model (2024), we aim to support our teachers in developing future-ready
learners and innovators. This investment in professional growth ensures
our educators continue to inspire and equip students to achieve their fullest
potential.</p>
<p>This year, we are also refreshing our 21st Century Competencies (21CC)
framework, focusing on the emerging priority competencies of Adaptive Thinking,
Communication, Civic Literacy, and Inventive Thinking. By emphasizing these
skills, we prepare our students to navigate the evolving educational and
global landscapes with confidence and agility. Reflecting our belief in
the adage “From the School as Our World to the World as Our School,” our
students will embrace opportunities for authentic, real-world learning
beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Central to our mission is our commitment to technology and innovation.
The “Transforming Education through Technology” Masterplan 2030 sets the
stage for integrating advanced digital tools into our teaching and learning
processes. A key initiative under this plan is strengthening Student Cyber
Wellness, ensuring our students are empowered to navigate the digital sphere
responsibly and ethically.</p>
<p>The path ahead is not without challenges, but with challenges come opportunities.
To succeed, we must embody the spirit of collaboration and service. Every
student, educator, and stakeholder in our community has a vital role in
shaping a culture where aspirations flourish. For our students to thrive
in this landscape, they must be creators of solutions, connectors who build
bridges, and contributors who leave a meaningful impact on the world.</p>
<p>As we look ahead to 2030 and beyond, let us remain united in our pursuit
of excellence. Together, we will forge pathways of learning, growth, and
discovery that reflect our shared commitment to service, leadership, and
transformation.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
