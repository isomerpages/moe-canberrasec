<p>I am both honoured and excited to commence my role as the Principal of
Canberra Secondary School. Embarking on this journey with each of you is
a privilege, and I am committed to steering our school with purpose and
passion. Education, to me, is not just a destination but an ongoing expedition
of growth and discovery. Our collective journey at Canberra is one of continuous
learning, adaptation, and progress.</p>
<p>In my leadership journey, I firmly adhere to the belief that we should
be "First to SERVE, then to LEAD." Leadership, in its truest form, is a
commitment to serving others before oneself. Through service, we will build
a foundation of trust, collaboration, and mutual respect. Together, we
will continue to foster a culture where Gratitude, Respect, and Compassion
are lived experiences for all our students and staff.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am guided by the conviction that we must always leave a place
better than we found it, ensuring that our actions contribute to the continual
improvement and enrichment of our students and staff. In Canberra, we are
anchored in values and purpose, recognising that the foundation of our
educational community lies in the shared commitment to uphold essential
principles. These values will serve as the compass directing our actions
and decisions.</p>
<p>At the heart of our mission are the beliefs that we value every student.
We firmly acknowledge that every student wants to learn and that, indeed,
all can learn. It is our duty to foster an environment where these aspirations
can flourish, creating a culture of curiosity, engagement, and achievement.</p>
<p>As we navigate the changing landscape for our students, characterised
by accelerated technological changes, an increasingly fragmented world,
and an evolving social fabric, we must prepare our students to connect,
create, and collaborate. It is our responsibility to equip them with the
skills and mindset necessary to thrive in this dynamic environment.</p>
<p>Our school programmes are designed with a clear focus to instil in our
students a passion for lifelong learning, equipping them with the skills
and knowledge necessary to thrive in an ever-evolving world. Our programmes
are inclusive and tailored to meet the needs of every Canberran, recognizing
and celebrating their unique perspectives, abilities, and backgrounds.
The well-being of our students is paramount. We are dedicated to creating
a supportive and nurturing environment that promotes not only academic
success but also the overall health and happiness of each student.</p>
<p>Recognising the rapid evolution of our education landscape and workplaces,
we are preparing our students for the dynamic future that awaits them.
Our teachers, the guiding forces in this journey, will embark on Professional
Development programmes, including the Teacher Work Attachment Plus (TWA+)
programme. This aims to equip our educators to guide students through the
volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) challenges that lie
ahead. The TWA+ programme, with its learning journeys and work attachments
in diverse sectors, will broaden our teachers' perspectives, enriching
their teaching and empowering them to guide students in making informed
choices about their educational and career pathways.</p>
<p>I am excited about the promising future awaiting Canberra Secondary School.
As we embark on this collective journey, let us embrace the path ahead
with open hearts and minds. Our shared commitment to service, leadership,
and leaving a lasting impact will serve as our guiding light, leading us
towards new horizons of achievement. Together,&nbsp; we will seize these
opportunities for growth, learning, and collaboration, navigating the ever-changing
landscape of education to prepare our students for success in the world
beyond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>Mr Leong Kok Kee</p>
<p>Principal</p>
