<p>To celebrate the Lunar New Year and foster strong bonds within the school
community, the Parent Support Group (PSG) organized a heartwarming CNY
Baking Workshop on 25 January at Canberra Secondary School's Kitchen. The
event welcomed 16 families from Sec 1 to Sec 4, creating a lively scene
of three generations coming together to share in the festive spirit.</p>

<p>Families, dressed in radiant red, joined hands to bake <strong>Almond Crisps</strong> under
the guidance of PSG members. In the true spirit of gratitude, participants
also prepared extra treats for the school’s janitorial staff as a heartfelt
gesture to thank them for their hard work in maintaining a clean and welcoming
environment for students.</p>
