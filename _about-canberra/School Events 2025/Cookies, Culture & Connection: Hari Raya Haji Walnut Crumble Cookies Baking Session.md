<p>On Saturday morning, 17 May 2025, the school kitchen filled with delightful
aromas during our Hari Raya Haji Walnut Crumble Cookies Baking Session.
From 9am to 12pm, families came together for this special event jointly
organized by our PSG Committee and PSG Exco team.</p>

<p>Thirteen families participated, with many new faces joining our Canberran
community for the first time. The session buzzed with laughter and teamwork
as parents and children bonded over cookie dough. As golden cookies emerged
from the ovens, families who had never met before began chatting and connecting,
transforming the kitchen into a warm community space.</p>

<p>Beyond the baking fun, the session honored the spirit of Hari Raya Haji
while promoting multicultural understanding within our Canberran community.
It was wonderful to see family bonds strengthen and new friendships form
over shared activities.</p>
<p>The event concluded with a delicious lunch and smiles all around. A special
thank you to our Nutrition and Food Science Department for their invaluable
support in making this memorable event possible!</p>
