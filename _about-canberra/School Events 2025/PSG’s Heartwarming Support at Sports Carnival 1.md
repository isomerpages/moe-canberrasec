<p>On Friday, 9 May 2025, our Parent Support Group stepped up to make Sports
Carnival 1 even more special. At the school canteen, PSG members set up
a refreshment stall offering ice pops, mineral water, packet Milo, and
instant noodles—all top student favorites chosen through a pre-event poll.</p>
<p>After hours of energetic competition under the hot sun, Canberrans were
delighted to cool down with refreshing treats. For those working up an
appetite, hot aromatic noodles provided the perfect comfort food.</p>

<p>Adding a thoughtful touch, PSG also offered artificial flowers with thank-you
cards, giving Canberrans a chance to show appreciation to their parents
ahead of Mother's Day. This gesture was warmly received and encouraged
students to express their gratitude.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic response from Canberrans was overwhelming—all food, drinks,
and flowers sold out in just over two hours! The PSG's thoughtful support
brought both relief from the heat and strengthened our Canberran community
spirit.</p>
