<p>What a fantastic turnout! Over 160 parents, teachers, and family members
joined us for our PSG End-of-Semester 1 celebration at the Cosmix, showcasing
the vibrant community spirit that makes Canberra Secondary School special.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights from the Evening</strong>
</p>
<p>The night began with a delicious self-service dinner where families had
the opportunity to connect and build new friendships. Our Principal, Mr.
Leong, shared exciting updates about our semester achievements and announced
the upcoming Overseas Learning Journeys to Bali and Cambodia for Secondary
3 students this June holiday—giving prospective families a glimpse of the
enriching experiences we offer our students.</p>
<p>Interactive games led by our enthusiastic PSG Vice-Chairman brought together
participants of all ages, from preschoolers to grandparents. The evening's
highlight came when parents invited Mr. Leong to join the activities—his
enthusiastic participation perfectly demonstrated the close-knit relationship
between our school leadership and families.</p>
<p>Our ICT Department created a beautiful photo montage showcasing the many
ways our Parent Support Group contributes to school life throughout the
semester, from volunteering at events to supporting student activities.</p>
<p>The evening was a wonderful celebration of our school community, with
genuine connections and plenty of laughter shared by all who attended.</p>
