<p>On 14 March 2025, Canberra Secondary School celebrated a milestone eventâ€”our
25th Anniversary and Awards Day. The theme for the day was "Minds That
Inspire, Hearts That Shine," reflecting our school's commitment to nurturing
both academic excellence and character development in our Canberrans.</p>
<p>The celebration was a meaningful occasion where the school community looked
back at our institution's remarkable 25-year journey, celebrated our Canberrans'
outstanding achievements, and expressed gratitude to the many individuals
who have supported the school's growth and success.</p>
<p>The event featured inspiring speeches from our Principal and the Guest
of Honour, which left a lasting impression on all attendees. The ceremony
created a strong sense of pride and unity among students, teachers, and
guests as they witnessed the recognition of Canberrans who excelled in
various areas including academics, co-curricular activities, and character
development.</p>
<p>The Awards Day served as a powerful reminder of the school's values and
mission, inspiring our Canberrans to continue striving for excellence while
making positive contributions to their school and wider community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The speeches given by our Principal and Guest of Honour were both encouraging
and heartfelt, leaving a strong impression on many of us. I could feel
a real sense of pride and unity among the students, teachers, and guests.
I was proud to receive an award and see so many students being recognised
for doing well in different areas like studies, CCA, and showing good character.
This Awards Day reminded me how lucky I am to be part of Canberra Secondary
School. It made me want to keep working hard and be someone who inspires
others and makes a difference."</p>
<p>--- Nguyen Hoang Long, 2 Honour</p>
