<p>The evening kicked off with a lively Bingo icebreaker led by a PSG Exco
member. Enthusiasm filled the air as participants, young and old alike,
mingled and bonded through friendly interactions. The vibrant atmosphere
set the tone for the rest of the event.</p>
<p>A highlight of the night was the traditional Lohei session, a unique practice
during the Chinese Lunar New Year. Many non-Chinese families experienced
this festive tradition for the first time, learning its symbolic significance
while enjoying the colorful and flavorful dish.</p>
