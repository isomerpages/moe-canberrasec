<h4><strong><u>Sec 1 GRC Celebration Week</u></strong></h4>
<p>The GRC Celebration Week was a vibrant and meaningful event aimed at strengthening
Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR), Peer-Student Relationships (PSR),
and fostering a deeper sense of belonging to Canberra Secondary School.
The week served as a celebration of our Canberra GRC GEMS program, which
recognizes the unique talents and qualities that make our students exceptional.</p>
<p>Through a carefully curated program, our Secondary 1 students engaged
in diverse activities designed to challenge them physically, mentally,
and socially. The innovative "Code for Fun" program offered students an
opportunity to develop their digital skills and explore coding basics in
an interactive environment, sparking interest in technology and problem-solving.</p>

<h4><strong>GRC Celebration Week: Empowering Students with Essential Life Skills</strong></h4>
<p>At Canberra Secondary School, our Secondary 3 students recently engaged
in an enriching two-day program designed to cultivate crucial life skills
and habits for success. This was part of the Cohort's programme for GRC
Celebration Week.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1: The Power of Effective Habits</strong>
<br>On October 17, our Secondary 3 cohort participated in a dynamic hands-on
workshop exploring "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" and selected <em>Habits of Mind</em>.
Through engaging activities, students developed essential skills including
personal responsibility, adaptability, and proactive thinking—foundations
crucial for both personal and academic success.</p>
<p>The day's highlight was an innovative engineering challenge where students
collaborated to build functioning roller coaster models. This practical
application of their newly acquired skills saw each class constructing
their own unique design, with the best models advancing to an exciting
final competition. The challenge effectively demonstrated how theoretical
principles of effective habits translate into real-world problem-solving
and teamwork.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: Life Skills in Action</strong>
<br>On October 18, under the guidance of our Assistant Year Head, students
immersed themselves in a variety of interactive activities designed to
strengthen core life competencies. The diverse program included:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Dynamic dance exercises</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team-based balloon tower construction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mindfulness and meditation sessions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time-based problem-solving challenges</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These activities specifically targeted crucial skills including:</p>

<li>
<p>Time management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stress management</p>
</li>

<p>Self-motivation</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Each activity was strategically designed to prepare students for their
upcoming challenges, including the National Examinations in 2025.</p>
<p>Throughout GRC Celebration Week, our Secondary 3 students not only gained
valuable insights and practical tools but also experienced the power of
collaborative learning. This engaging approach to personal development
has equipped them with skills that will serve them well in both their academic
journey and beyond.</p>
