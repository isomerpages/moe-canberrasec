<h4><strong><u>Sec 1 GRC Celebration Week</u></strong></h4>
<p>The GRC Celebration Week was a vibrant and meaningful event aimed at strengthening
Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR), Peer-Student Relationships (PSR),
and fostering a deeper sense of belonging to Canberra Secondary School.
The week served as a celebration of our Canberra GRC GEMS program, which
recognizes the unique talents and qualities that make our students exceptional.</p>
<p>Through a carefully curated program, our Secondary 1 students engaged
in diverse activities designed to challenge them physically, mentally,
and socially. The innovative "Code for Fun" program offered students an
opportunity to develop their digital skills and explore coding basics in
an interactive environment, sparking interest in technology and problem-solving.</p>

<p>These activities not only promoted physical fitness but also emphasized
sportsmanship, resilience, and mutual support. Students learned valuable
lessons in effective communication and team collaboration while strengthening
their peer relationships.</p>
<p>Adding to the week's comprehensive approach, students attended an Education
and Career Guidance (ECG) workshop that provided valuable insights into
future academic and career pathways. This session equipped them with essential
information for making informed choices in their academic journey.</p>
