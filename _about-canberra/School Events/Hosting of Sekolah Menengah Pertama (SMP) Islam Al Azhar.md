<p>Earlier this year, Canberra Secondary School welcomed a delegation of
students from Indonesia as part of our international cultural exchange
programme. This meaningful initiative strengthened ties between our institutions
while providing Canberrans with valuable exposure to Indonesian culture
and educational practices.</p>
<p>The programme featured structured activities designed to foster mutual
understanding and friendship between students from both countries. Our
Canberrans participated in collaborative learning sessions, cross-cultural
discussions, and shared experiences that broadened their global perspectives
and enhanced their appreciation for diversity.</p>
<p>The exchange concluded successfully with both student groups expressing
enthusiasm for continued cooperation and friendship. Such programmes reinforce
our school's commitment to developing Canberrans as informed global citizens
who can contribute positively to our interconnected world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I had the privilege of taking on two important roles during the visitâ€”serving
as the emcee for the welcome ceremony and being appointed as one of their
student buddies. Being able to communicate with them in Bahasa Indonesia
added a warm, personal touch to our conversations and helped us connect
more genuinely. During their stay, I guided them around our school campus,
proudly showcasing key features that reflect Canberra Secondary's identity
and vibrancy. One of the most touching moments came at the end of the programme
when our Indonesian friends presented us with a beautifully handcrafted
souvenir. This experience was truly unforgettable. It not only deepened
my appreciation for intercultural exchange but also reminded me of the
power of communication, empathy, and shared learning. I walked away with
new friendships, broader horizons, and a deeper sense of what it means
to be a global citizen."</p>
