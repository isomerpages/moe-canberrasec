<p>On 9 May 2025, Canberra Secondary School held its annual Sports Carnival.
The event was filled with excitement, energy, and team spirit as our Canberrans
participated in various sports competitions including Captain's Ball, Basketball
and Frisbee.</p>
<p>From the moment our Canberrans arrived, the atmosphere was electric with
cheering and teachers coordinating the festivities. The carnival provided
an excellent platform for students to showcase their athletic abilities,
demonstrate teamwork, and celebrate sportsmanship across all year levels.</p>
<p>Throughout the matches, participants displayed remarkable team spirit,
supporting their teammates and maintaining positive attitudes even when
facing challenges. The event emphasized not just winning, but also the
importance of having fun, learning together, and building lasting friendships
through sports.</p>
<p>The carnival concluded with an exciting prize presentation ceremony, where
winning classes were announced amid thunderous cheers and celebration.
The energy and enthusiasm demonstrated by all Canberrans made the inaugural
Sports Carnival a truly memorable and meaningful experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We were both nervous at first since it was our first time joining Sports
Day in secondary school. One of us played Captain's Ball, and the other
played Basketball. Once the games started, our nerves went away, and we
started enjoying every moment. During the matches, we shouted encouragement
to each other, passed the ball around, and worked hard as a team. We felt
proud when we received our medals and prizes because we had trained hard,
and it showed our efforts paid off. At the end of the day, we were tired
but very happy. It was truly a fun and meaningful experience, and we're
already looking forward to next year's!"</p>
