<p>The Mother Tongue Department recently organized the <strong>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight</strong> and <strong>Lunar New Year Celebration</strong>,
giving students the chance to learn about Chinese culture in a fun and
interactive way.</p>
<p>During <strong>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight</strong>, students explored <strong>cultural booths</strong> where
they tried <strong>calligraphy, fan painting, lantern making, and Mandarin orange craft</strong>.
They also played <strong>traditional games</strong> such as <strong>spinning top, pitch-the-pot, pick-up sticks, and five stones</strong>.
To bring festive cheer to the school, students took part in the <strong>Classroom Decoration Competition</strong>,
using <strong>Lunar New Year ornaments and recycled materials</strong> to
decorate their classrooms. This year, their decorations were inspired by
the <strong>zodiac animal—the Snake</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Lunar New Year Celebration</strong> was a lively and meaningful
event. It started with <strong>Lo Hei sessions</strong>, where students
and their form teachers tossed the festive dish while exchanging good wishes.
After that, they took part in <strong>craft activities</strong>, such as <strong>clay modeling, lantern painting, ink and wash painting, terracotta warrior making, and traditional Chinese architecture crafting</strong>.
They also had fun playing classic <strong>traditional games</strong> like <strong>iron-hoop rolling and Chinese yoyo</strong>.</p>
<p>The celebration ended with <strong>exciting performances</strong>. Our
talented <strong>Guzheng Ensemble and Dance Club</strong> performed, followed
by thrilling acts from <strong>external performers</strong>, including the <strong>Festival Drums, an acrobatic show, a Lion Dance, and a special appearance by the God of Fortune</strong>,
who brought blessings and joy to everyone.</p>
<p>Through these activities, students not only <strong>learned more about Chinese culture and traditions</strong> but
also <strong>bonded with their friends and teachers</strong>. The event
encouraged them to <strong>appreciate diversity, express gratitude, and celebrate the Lunar New Year in a meaningful way</strong>.</p>
