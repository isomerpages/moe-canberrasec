<p>In January 2025, the Mother Tongue Department organized the Mother Tongue
Language Fortnight and Lunar New Year Celebration, giving our Canberrans
the chance to learn about Chinese culture in a fun and interactive way.</p>
<p>During Mother Tongue Language Fortnight, Canberrans explored cultural
booths where they tried calligraphy, fan painting, lantern making, and
Mandarin orange craft. They also played traditional games such as spinning
top, pitch-the-pot, pick-up sticks, and five stones. To bring festive cheer
to the school, students took part in the Classroom Decoration Competition,
using Lunar New Year ornaments and recycled materials to decorate their
classrooms. This year, their decorations were inspired by the zodiac animal—the
Snake.</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year Celebration was a lively and meaningful event. It started
with Lo Hei sessions (the traditional prosperity toss salad ritual), where
our Canberrans and their form teachers tossed the festive dish while exchanging
good wishes. They also took part in craft activities, such as clay modeling,
lantern painting, ink and wash painting, terracotta warrior making, and
traditional Chinese architecture crafting. They also had fun playing classic
traditional games like iron-hoop rolling and Chinese yoyo.</p>
<p>The celebration ended with exciting performances. Our talented Guzheng
Ensemble and Dance Club performed, followed by thrilling acts from external
performers, including the Festival Drums, an acrobatic show, a Lion Dance,
and a special appearance by the God of Fortune, who brought blessings and
joy to everyone.</p>
<p>Through these activities, our Canberrans not only learned more about Chinese
culture and traditions but also bonded with their friends and teachers.
The event encouraged them to appreciate diversity, express gratitude, and
celebrate the Lunar New Year in a meaningful way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This year's Chinese New Year celebration in school was truly memorable.
I enjoyed taking part in the various cultural activities like calligraphy,
lantern making, and Lo Hei. These hands-on experiences helped me learn
more about Chinese culture in a fun and interactive way. One of the most
enjoyable moments was doing Lo Hei with my classmates. Tossing the colourful
ingredients together while shouting auspicious phrases created a joyful
atmosphere and strengthened our class spirit. Through these activities,
I gained a stronger appreciation for traditions and the importance of showing
compassion and kindness to others."</p>
