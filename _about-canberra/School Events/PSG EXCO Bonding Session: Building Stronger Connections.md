<h4>PSG EXCO Bonding Session: Building Stronger Connections</h4>
<p>The PSG EXCO bonding session began with a warm and hearty breakfast that
set a friendly tone for the day. A highlight of the morning was an engaging
activity where participants painted Indian oil lamps, facilitated by an
alumni parent. Each lamp turned out unique, reflecting the distinct perspectives
and artistic expressions of each participant—an apt metaphor for the PSG
itself. Just as each lamp showed its own creative flair, the PSG members
bring diverse strengths and insights to their shared mission of supporting
the school, with each contribution enhancing the partnership in unique
ways.</p>

<p>Throughout the past year, the PSG has organized several successful events
and initiatives. Our quarterly dialogues with school leaders have fostered
open communication and understanding between parents and the school administration.
A highlight was the Secondary 1 Lohei and recruitment event during Lunar
New Year, which warmly welcomed new families to our community.</p>
<p>The PSG has also organized various enriching activities that brought families
together. These included cooking sessions where parents shared their culinary
expertise through Indian curry cooking workshops and mooncake making classes.
Our fortnightly Saturday morning badminton sessions in the school hall
have become a cherished tradition, creating valuable bonding time for parents
and children alike.</p>
<p>During the session, we revisited the fundamental purpose of the PSG within
the school community. We emphasized our four key roles:</p>

<li>
<p>Partner in education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridge between parents and school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Source of peer support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Welcoming community for new parents</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also discussed the importance of our level-based WhatsApp chat groups,
including guidelines for maintaining these as positive and supportive communication
channels.</p>

commitment to enriching the home-school partnership.</p>

<h4><strong>Parent Reflections</strong></h4>
<p>"When I noticed my child embarking on their teenage journey, I realized
that I, too, needed to grow as a parent. I needed to listen more and respond
thoughtfully. Joining the Parent Support Group (PSG) was, in part, a personal
decision—perhaps even a selfish one. I wanted to surround myself with like-minded
parents who are striving just as I am. There are times when we feel unsure
of what we're doing, but we choose to show up and stay present. Through
this shared camaraderie, I feel more empowered to support our secondary
school children on their journey to becoming their best selves." - <em>Cecilia, mother of Secondary 1 student</em>
</p>
<p>"I joined the PSG to actively contribute to my children's education and
to meaningfully support the school community. Staying engaged in their
educational journey is important to me. Over the years, I have witnessed
how partnerships between parents and the school can create a positive and
enriching environment for students. Through the PSG at CBSS, I enjoy building
strong relationships with teachers and fellow parents while helping to
organize events and initiatives that benefit the students. It is incredibly
rewarding to support the school’s efforts in nurturing well-rounded learners
and to be part of a community that values teamwork and shared responsibility."

<br>"I joined the PSG to actively contribute to my child’s educational journey
and overall well-being during her teenage years. This is a crucial stage
when children face academic challenges, develop their identity, and navigate
social dynamics. Being part of the PSG allows me to stay connected with
the school, understand its initiatives, and collaborate with other parents
to create a supportive environment.</p>
<p>I believe I can support my teenage child by being more involved in their
school community, fostering open communication, and better understanding
their needs. Through PSG activities, I hope to set a positive example of
participation and teamwork while also building a network of resources to
guide and support them through this important phase of life." - <em>Athena Wong, mother of Secondary 1 girl</em>
</p>
<p>"Being part of the parent support group allows me to contribute to her
educational environment and overall well-being. It provides an opportunity
to build connections with other parents, teachers, and staff while collaborating
to create a supportive community. Through this involvement, I can play
an active role in enhancing school programs, addressing shared concerns,
and celebrating milestones together. Most importantly, it demonstrates
to my daughter the value of involvement, the importance of fostering relationships,
and the commitment to supporting her growth both in and out of the classroom."
