<p>Parents of the Secondary Two cohort were invited to the Streaming Talk
held in the evening of 4<sup>th</sup> April and many attended the informative
session together with their children. The talk focused on subject combinations,
post-secondary education pathways and how subject choices might implicate
the future academic endeavours of students. Through the engaging and comprehensive
presentations, parents were equipped with valuable insights to guide their
children towards a fulfilling educational journey. We would like to thank
parents for their active participation and we look forward to continuing
this collaborative journey in nurturing all studentsâ€™ potential.</p>
