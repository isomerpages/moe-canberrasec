<p>As part of our academic and character development, we have the Global Canberran Programme (GCP) for our students to facilitate this internationalisation process. The GCP educational travel has enabled our students to learn beyond classroom walls. Students who participate in educational travel benefit from exposure to new people, experiences, and cultures. Along with a better understanding of subject material, the GCP educational travel has also provided opportunities for students to grow in self-confidence and independence.</p>

<p>The following reflections by our students attest to the benefits and results of the GCP:</p>
<p>I learnt that showing leadership is not easy in a group of different people but if we cooperate and do everything as a team, every tough challenge will become easy.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the 6-day trip and I felt that it was very meaningful. I know more about Korea's culture and history. I think that Koreans are all very polite. When we visited the Dongguk Girls' Middle school, I realised that all the students there respect their teachers very much. When they walked past their teachers, they would bow and greet them. In Singapore, we only greet teachers in the classroom. During the lesson that we observed, the students sat down quietly and listened to the teacher. They paid close attention to the teacher.</p>

<p>In Singapore, the places are clean but people are quite rude. In Taiwan, the places and buildings are cluttered together yet the people are kind and warm. There are three good aspects that I have learned in Taiwan: <br />1. When people are crossing the road, the drivers would not honk at us but simply patiently wait for us to cross the road.&nbsp;<br />2. There are no rubbish bins in every place. Nonetheless, I was shocked that there was no rubbish in the middle of the road or path. Taiwanese have a strong pride for cleanliness.&nbsp;<br />3. The people would give way to the people who walked first. They would simply wait for the people to pass through first&nbsp;.<br /><br /><strong>Cultural Immersion to Taiwan, Natalie Woo, 2E1 </strong>&nbsp;</p>
