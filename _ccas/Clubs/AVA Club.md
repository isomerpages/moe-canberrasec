<h3><strong>AVA Club (New CCA in 2025!)</strong></h3>
<p>A new CCA in 2025, our Audio Visual Aid (AVA) Club is a unique CCA at
Canberra Secondary School. As a service CCA, our members are focused on
providing essential support for school events and the daily operations
of the school. This includes using the public announcement system, providing
sound support during sports events, and more.</p>
<p>Through the demands of servicing school events, AVA club members will
learn the importance of responsibility, punctuality, and teamwork. Leadership
skills will also be developed as they learn to communicate effectively,
manage events, and delegate roles to different members. As a result, AVA
members will become a closely-knit group, demonstrating strong teamwork
to ensure each event flows seamlessly.</p>
<p>The weekly technical equipment training will allow the students to hone
their skills in operating audio-visual equipment. In addition to these
trainings, the club will also conduct learning journeys, embark on projects,
and take on challenges for students to discover their true potential, build
self-confidence, and develop tenacity.</p>
<p>If you are interested in handling AVA equipment and have a passion for
audio-visual technology, we welcome you to join our club in 2025. Come
and be a part of this unique service CCA that will play a crucial role
in supporting the school's events and daily operations!</p>
