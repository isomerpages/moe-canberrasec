<h3><strong>Audio-visual Innovators (AI) Club (New CCA in 2025!)</strong></h3>
<p>A new CCA in 2025, our Audio-visual Innovators (AI)<strong> </strong>Club
is a unique CCA at Canberra Secondary School. As a service CCA, our members
are focused on providing essential support for school events and the daily
operations of the school. This includes using the public announcement system,
providing sound support during sports events, and more.</p>
<p>Through the demands of servicing school events, AI club members will learn
the importance of responsibility, punctuality, and teamwork. Leadership
skills will also be developed as they learn to communicate effectively,
manage events, and delegate roles to different members. As a result, AI
members will become a closely-knit group, demonstrating strong teamwork
to ensure each event flows seamlessly.</p>
<p>The weekly technical equipment training will allow the students to hone
their skills in operating audio-visual equipment. In addition to these
trainings, the club will also conduct learning journeys, embark on projects,
and take on challenges for students to discover their true potential, build
self-confidence, and develop tenacity.</p>
<p>If you are interested in handling AVA equipment and have a passion for
audio-visual technology, we welcome you to join our club in 2025. Come
and be a part of this unique service CCA that will play a crucial role
in supporting the school's events and daily operations!</p>
