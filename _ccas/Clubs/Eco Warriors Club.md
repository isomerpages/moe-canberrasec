<h3><strong>Eco-Warriors Club (New CCA in 2025!)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Eco Warriors Club</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>About Us</strong>
</p>
<p>As our planet faces mounting challenges from climate change and resource
depletion, Canberra Secondary School's Eco Warriors are leading the charge
towards a greener future. Operating on our distinctive Triple 'A' framework—Awareness,
Action, and Advocacy—this dynamic club has made significant strides in
fostering environmental consciousness among our&nbsp;<strong>Canberrans</strong>.</p>
<p>At its heart, the Eco Warriors Club embodies Canberra Secondary's commitment
to environmental kindness, proving that small actions today can create
significant positive change for tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Current Projects and Achievements</strong>
</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;<strong>Eco Warriors</strong>&nbsp;have been busy transforming
environmental consciousness within our school community. Working alongside
Green Leaders from every class, they planned and carried out compelling
school-wide campaigns for Global Recycling Week and Earth Week 2025.&nbsp;<strong>Our Canberrans</strong>&nbsp;particularly
enjoyed old school games conducted using recyclables, such as "Strike the
Cans" and bottle-flipping during Global Recycling Week, while the "Tech
for Tomorrow" e-waste collection drive and "Power Down, Design Up" sticker
design competition during Earth Week sparked enthusiastic participation
across all levels. The creative blend of competition and environmental
education has been well-received thus far, with many&nbsp;<strong>Canberrans</strong>&nbsp;eagerly
embracing these eco-friendly initiatives.</p>
<p>In an exciting Farm-to-Table initiative, our&nbsp;<strong>Eco Warriors</strong>&nbsp;are
learning hydroponics, bringing sustainable agriculture directly to our
school. This hands-on experience will culminate in sharing locally grown
produce with our school community, demonstrating the viability of urban
farming.</p>
<p><strong>Student Voice</strong>
</p>
<p>"This visit reinforced our club's mission of environmental conservation
and helped me understand why protecting biodiversity is crucial for our
planet's future. As an Eco Warrior, I'm now more motivated to educate my
schoolmates and contribute to conservation efforts."</p>
