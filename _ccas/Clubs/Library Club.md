<p>The Library Club offers numerous opportunities for members to develop
essential skills such as leadership, teamwork, creativity, and communication.
As part of the club’s VIA project, our student librarians will be part
of the National Library Board’s kidsREAD programme. Through their involvement
in different programmes, student librarians grow into caring, confident
individuals and effective reading ambassadors..</p>
