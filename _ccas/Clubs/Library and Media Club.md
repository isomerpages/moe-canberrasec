<h3>Library and Media Club (New CCA in 2025!)</h3>
<p>The Library and Media Club is an exciting new CCA that combines library
stewardship with student journalism. We are dedicated to nurturing student
librarians who not only care for our library but also serve as the authentic
voice of our school community through reporting and storytelling.</p>

<p><strong>Vision</strong>: To transform our school library into a dynamic
hub where students become both knowledge keepers and storytellers, bringing
school events and student experiences to life through meaningful reporting.</p>

<p>In the Library and Media Club, students will take on meaningful roles
as both library stewards and school journalists. Members will develop essential
skills in news writing, interviewing, and event coverage while maintaining
their responsibilities as custodians of our library resources. They will
be the eyes and ears of our school community, providing thoughtful coverage
of school events and bringing student perspectives to life through their
reporting. Members will also have the opportunity to participate in the
National Library Board's kidsREAD programme, enriching their experience
as ambassadors of reading and storytelling.</p>
