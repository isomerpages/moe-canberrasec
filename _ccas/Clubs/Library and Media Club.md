<h3>Library and Media Club (New CCA in 2025!)</h3>
<p><strong>About Us</strong>
</p>
<p>The Library and Media Club cultivates a strong reading culture and develops
21st-century media skills among our Canberrans. Through regular reading
initiatives, student-led reporting, and multimedia coverage of school events,
our members express themselves and amplify the voices of their peers. Our
Canberrans learn the art of interviewing, videography, and video editing,
while participating in inter-school competitions to refine their skills.
The club provides a platform for creative expression, critical thinking,
and meaningful engagement within the school community.</p>

<p><strong>Current Projects and Achievements</strong>
</p>
<p>Our members are actively developing their skills as news journalists within
the school community. We recently completed a 600-word report and video
clip for submission to the Prove-it Contest. During Awards Days, our team
filmed and interviewed award winners from Secondary 2, 3, and 4. This has
been an enriching and rewarding experience as students have learned to
record, edit, and post videos and pictures.</p>
<p>As the voices of Canberrans, we continue to expand our role in school
communications. We are also working to promote a reading culture throughout
the school, with more exciting events planned ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Student Voice</strong>
</p>
<p>"It has been an enriching and rewarding experience thus far as we have
learnt how to record, edit, and post videos or pictures. We are looking
forward to do even more as the voices of Canberrans."</p>
