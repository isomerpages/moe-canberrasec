<h3><strong>Robotics Club: Building the Future, One Bot at a Time</strong></h3>
<p>The Robotics CCA at Canberra Secondary School is a newly established club
focused on the VEX V5 Robotics platform. The CCA provides students with
hands-on experience in STEM through robot design, building, and programming.
In just two years, the CCA has already made its mark by winning several
awards in local and regional competitions. Students learn teamwork, engineering
design principles and creative problem-solving as they prepare for national
and international VEX tournaments.</p>
