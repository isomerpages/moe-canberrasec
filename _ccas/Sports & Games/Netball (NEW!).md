<p><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong>
</p>
<p>In just its second year since its relaunch in 2024, Netball at Canberra
Secondary School continues to grow from strength to strength.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team is currently participating in the 2025 National School Games
(NSG) C Division, marking an important milestone. Competing with heart
and determination, our players finished 3rd in their group during the pool
games and secured their spot in the upcoming League games in Term 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year the team welcomed 10 enthusiastic Secondary One students, bringing
fresh energy and strong potential. With consistent training and support,
the team continues to sharpen their gameplay, deepen their bonds, and strive
towards excellence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond competition, Netball CCA remains committed to building a positive
team culture where players lift one another up, learn through every game,
and carry these lessons into their daily lives. With growing interest and
an unbreakable spirit, the journey of Canberra Netball is just getting
started.</p>
