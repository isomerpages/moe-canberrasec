<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>
<br>The Netball team at Canberra Secondary School aims to instill values of
teamwork, perseverance and sportsmanship in its players. The team strives
to create a nurturing environment where students can develop both their
athletic skills and personal growth. The goal is to foster a lifelong love
for the sport and to help students embody the school's core values of Gratitude,
Respect and Compassion.</p>
<h4><strong>Motto</strong></h4>
<p>
<br>The motto <em>"Triumph through Tenacity"</em> reflects the belief that success
comes through persistent effort and determination. Players are encouraged
to face challenges head-on, maintain a positive attitude and continually
strive for improvement. This philosophy not only applies to their performance
on the court but also helps shape their character and resilience in all
aspects of life.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>With the reopening of Netball as a CCA in 2024, 11 energetic Secondary
One Canberrans form the first batch of netballers. Training sessions focus
on skill development, teamwork and strategy, ensuring that every player
reaches their full potential. The team is committed to fostering growth,
both on and off the court.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the CCA has its sights set on the National School Games
and external competitions in 2025. These events will provide a platform
for showcasing the players' hard work and determination. The hope is that
the netballers will continue to focus on growth, teamwork and seizing opportunities.</p>
<p>The reopening of Netball as one of the newest sports CCAs in Canberra
Secondary School promises an exciting journey ahead for all involved, setting
the stage for future successes in school sports.</p>
