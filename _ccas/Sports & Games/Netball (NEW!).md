<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>The Netball team at Canberra Secondary School aims to instill values of
teamwork, perseverance and sportsmanship in its players. The team strives
to create a nurturing environment where students can develop both their
athletic skills and personal growth. Our goal is to foster a lifelong love
for the sport and to help students embody the school's core values of Gratitude,
Respect and Compassion.</p>
<h4><strong>Motto</strong></h4>
<p>"Triumph through Tenacity”: We believe that perseverance is the key to
progress. Our netballers are encouraged to embrace challenges with grit,
a growth mindset and a positive attitude, both on and off the court.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>In just its second year since its relaunch in 2024, Netball at Canberra
Secondary School continues to grow from strength to strength.</p>
<p>The team is currently participating in the 2025 National School Games
(NSG) C Division, marking an important milestone. Competing with heart
and determination, our players finished 3rd in their group during the pool
games and secured their spot in the upcoming League games in Term 3.</p>
