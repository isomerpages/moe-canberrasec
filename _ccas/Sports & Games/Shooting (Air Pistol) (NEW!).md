<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>The Shooting (Air Pistol) CCA aims to instill the values of precision,
discipline, and concentration in our students, extending beyond marksmanship
skills to mental and emotional development. Through regular training sessions,
competitions, and focused practice, we teach valuable life skills, promote
mental acuity, and foster a sense of self-control. This CCA plays a vital
role in shaping focused, disciplined individuals ready to face life's challenges
with steady hands and clear minds.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>Our Shooting (Air Pistol) training sessions are designed to enhance students'
physical control, mental focus, and emotional stability, preparing them
for competitions at various levels. The CCA, launched this year, comprises
6 dedicated members from Secondary One and Two who train twice a week at
the Yishun SAFRA Indoor Weapon Range. Under expert guidance, members learn
proper stance, aiming techniques, and crucial safety protocols, developing
both individual skills and team spirit.</p>

<p>Despite being newly established, our shooters have already demonstrated
their prowess in competitions. At the SAFRA Quarterly Shoot, Jayvier secured
gold in the Men's Air Pistol (Novice) category, Jun Xiang achieved 5th
place, and Bella attained first runner-up in the Women's Air Pistol (Novice)
category. The team also participated in the National School Games (NSG)
C Division competition, gaining valuable experience for future events.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skills, our program emphasizes the development of mental
fortitude and emotional control, which are crucial in both shooting and
daily life. While our members didn't qualify for the NSG finals this year,
their determination to improve and succeed embodies our school's values
of perseverance and continuous growth. This holistic approach ensures that
participants develop not only as marksmen but also as well-rounded individuals
with strong character and unwavering focus. Stay tuned for updates on their
progress and upcoming competitions!</p>
