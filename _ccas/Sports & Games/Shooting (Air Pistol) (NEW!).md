#### **Vision**

The Shooting (Air Pistol) CCA aims to instill the values of precision, discipline, and concentration in our students, extending beyond marksmanship skills to mental and emotional development. Through regular training sessions, competitions, and focused practice, we teach valuable life skills, promote mental acuity, and foster a sense of self-control. This CCA plays a vital role in shaping focused, disciplined individuals ready to face life's challenges with steady hands and clear minds.

#### **Highlights and Achievements**

Our Shooting (Air Pistol) training sessions are designed to enhance students' physical control, mental focus, and emotional stability, preparing them for competitions at various levels. The CCA, launched this year, comprises 6 dedicated members from Secondary One and Two who train twice a week at the Yishun SAFRA Indoor Weapon Range. Under expert guidance, members learn proper stance, aiming techniques, and crucial safety protocols, developing both individual skills and team spirit.

Despite being newly established, our shooters have already demonstrated their prowess in competitions. At the SAFRA Quarterly Shoot, Jayvier secured gold in the Men's Air Pistol (Novice) category, Jun Xiang achieved 5th place, and Bella attained first runner-up in the Women's Air Pistol (Novice) category. The team also participated in the National School Games (NSG) C Division competition, gaining valuable experience for future events.

Beyond technical skills, our program emphasizes the development of mental fortitude and emotional control, which are crucial in both shooting and daily life. While our members didn't qualify for the NSG finals this year, their determination to improve and succeed embodies our school's values of perseverance and continuous growth. This holistic approach ensures that participants develop not only as marksmen but also as well-rounded individuals with strong character and unwavering focus. Stay tuned for updates on their progress and upcoming competitions!
