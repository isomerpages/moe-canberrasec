<p>Our program is designed to cultivate teamwork, sportsmanship, and a winning
spirit through healthy competition. We believe in the power of rigorous

for opportunities and respectful of one another's differences and perspectives.</p>

<p>Our Canberrans have the chance to showcase their talents and compete at
various prestigious local competitions, including the National Schools
Games and the Volleyball Association of Singapore (VAS) Under 13 and Under
16 competitions. These platforms provide invaluable experiences for our
athletes to test their skills, demonstrate their growth, and appreciate
the world of competitive sports.</p>
<p>We tailor our training programs to meet the diverse needs of our Canberrans,
ensuring they improve in physical, cognitive, and emotional aspects. Our
comprehensive yearly program includes regular friendly matches with partner
schools and immersive training camps, all designed to foster a strong,
unified team spirit.</p>

<p><strong>Highlights for 2025 NSG</strong>
</p>
<p>Led by passionate coaches and fueled by unwavering determination, our
B Division volleyball players have showcased hard work, talent and resilience
throughout their journey in the National School Games. Whether in practice
sessions or intense matches, they exhibited a persistent pursuit of excellence,
constantly pushing their limits to reach new heights. Beyond their abilities
on the court, our volleyball teams have also exemplified the true spirit
of camaraderie. They celebrated victories together, supported each other
in times of defeat, and forged bonds that extended far beyond the court.
Through their unity and mutual support, they inspire the younger players
to strive for greatness, both individually and as a team.</p>
<p>However, their success is not measured solely in wins and losses. It is
reflected in the lessons learned, the friendships formed, and the memories
created. Our volleyball teams continue to embody the values of perseverance,
discipline, and sportsmanship.</p>

<p><strong>Student Voices</strong>
</p>
<p>"I have had the honour of serving as the Captain of the Canberra Volleyball
Girls Team for the past four years. Throughout this journey, I have witnessed
the unwavering dedication, resilience, and spirit of my teammates—qualities
that make me immensely proud. This experience shaped me both as a player
and a leader. I developed strong skills in teamwork, communication, and
time management, while also learning how to lead by example, motivate others,
and stay focused on a common goal."</p>
<p>--- Sharlene, 2025 B Division (Girls) Team Captain</p>
<p>"Throughout these four years, I am very proud and deeply grateful to have
been a part of this team. While we may not have achieved many accolades
or medals, it has been a privilege to grow together—not just in our craft,
but also in our character and attitude. As captain, I've learned what it
truly means to be a leader—not a boss. Leadership is about shaping others
while continuing to build myself."</p>
<p>--- Shan He, 2025 B Division (Boys) Team Captain</p>
<p>"I joined volleyball because I have really loved the sport ever since
I first joined in primary 3. Since the environment is very positive and
everyone wants to be the best version of themselves, it inspires me to
want to get better. Some of my future goals are to be able to play in nationals
and to win something on the team to prove that I'm capable of being on
court and helping score points."</p>
