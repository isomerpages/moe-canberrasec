<h4><strong>Highlights for 2024 NSG</strong></h4>
<p>Led by passionate coaches and fueled by unwavering determination, our
B Division volleyball players have showcased hard work, talent and resilience
throughout their journey in the National School Games. Whether in practice
sessions or intense matches, they had exhibited a persistent pursuit of
excellence, constantly pushing their limits to reach new heights. Beyond
their abilities on the court, our volleyball teams have also exemplified
the true spirit of camaraderie. They celebrated victories together, supported
each other in times of defeat, and forged bonds that extended far beyond
the court. Through their unity and mutual support, they will inspire the
younger players to strive for greatness, both individually and as a team.</p>
<p>However, their success is not measured solely in wins and losses. It is
reflected in the lessons learned, the friendships formed, and the memories
created. Our volleyball teams will continue to embody the values of perseverance,
discipline, and sportsmanship.</p>

<p><strong>Below are a few words by our B Division team captains:</strong>
</p>
<p><em>It is with great pride that I commend the resilience and teamwork demonstrated by each member. We may not have secured many victories in the National round, but the experience has been invaluable for our personal and collective growth. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our advisors, Ms. Jenny Soh and Mr. Whelan, our devoted teachers, Ms. Victoria, Ms. Tham, and Ms. Rani, and our esteemed coach, Ms Sheefa, for their relentless support throughout our journey in the North Zone and Nationals. Though this marks the conclusion of my journey with the volleyball team, I am confident that our juniors will carry forward our legacy with the same passion and strive for greater achievements in the future. - Elnora, B Division (Girls) team captain</em>
</p>
<p><em>I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt appreciation to each and every member of our team. Though we may not have made it into the top 4 for North Zone, I am incredibly proud of the effort, dedication, and sportsmanship displayed by each player throughout our journey. I am thankful for the privilege of leading such a dedicated group of individuals, and I look forward to seeing where our collective determination takes us in the future. Let's hold our heads high, cherish the moments we've shared, and continue to strive for excellence both on and off the court. Thank you, team, for your hard work and your passion. You have made me proud to be your captain. - Ryan, B Division (Boys) team captain</em>
