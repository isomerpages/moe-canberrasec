<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Canberra Secondary’s Girls’ Brigade (GB) company seeks to develop every
girl to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling “Every
girl a leader, every officer a servant leader”. Our activities are designed
to enable our girls to develop meaningful friendships and lasting memories,
and we strive to instil a strong sense of discipline, responsibility and
compassion as they work towards their goals. Our company also promotes
independence and leadership within the girls as they grow with activities,
and with mentorship from their seniors and alumni. Additionally, by working
together with one another, we hope to strengthen the sense of belonging
and togetherness among the girls, ensuring no one is left behind.</p>

<h4><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>Every year in the month of March, our girls go through the "Passing On
Parade" (POP), where the next batch of executive committee is appointed,
and the graduating cohort is celebrated for their hard work and effort
throughout their 4 years in GB. Throughout the year, our girls go through
annual camps, such as Leadership Camps where the girls take on new roles
and responsibilities. We also conduct Induction Camps, where we welcome
the new Secondary 1 students into our company. Adventure Camps, where our
girls try new activities such as roller skating and rock climbing. Lastly,
our Day Camps where our girls spend time with their squads throughout the
day.</p>

consecutive year. In 2018, our sec 4 girls took part in the Drill Competition,
in which our company clinched the Bronze award. In 2023, we got the Silver

and officers for their effort, hard work and support. We will continue
to work hard to blossom into resilient and exemplary servant leaders who
will leave a lasting positive legacy on our society.</p>
