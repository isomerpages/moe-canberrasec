<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is dedicated to cultivating resourceful,
responsible, resilient, and loyal leaders and team players through engaging

fit body, and a committed heart.</p>

<p>Cadets also participate in various programmes organized by NCC HQ:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Camp Forge: Featuring activities like Flying Fox and Archery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Camp Steel: Including Paintball and Rappelling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Senior Specialist Leaders Course: Offering experiences like Land Expeditions
and Fitness Challenges</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These activities are designed to foster an adventurous spirit while learning
through fun and challenging experiences.</p>
<p>To further enrich their learning experience, cadets engage in activities
like the Precision Drill Squad (PDS), Kayaking, and Drone Workshops. These
activities not only build their future-ready skillsets but also strengthen
camaraderie among the cadets, making their NCC journey more fulfilling.</p>
<p>Through this diverse array of programmes and activities, we aim to develop
strong, well-rounded and future-ready cadets who embody the "Cadet Strong"
spirit and are prepared to face the challenges of the future.</p>
