<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>In alignment with the aims of our HQ NCDCC (National Civil Defence Cadet
Corps) and our parent organization SCDF (Singapore Civil Defence Force),
Canberra Secondary School's NCDCC seeks to nurture and develop our youths
into resilient and responsible citizens through innovative and challenging
Civil Defence activities. It is a choice Uniformed Group (UG) that equips
our youths with life-saving skills for challenging times ahead.</p>

<p>NCDCC's curriculum focuses mainly on the Triangle of Life Skills, which
includes basic firefighting, first aid, and CPR+AED. These are important
lifesaving skills that can make a difference in saving lives during emergencies.</p>
<p>Canberra Secondary School's NCDCC unit was established in 2019 as a new
and dynamic platform to nurture character and leadership development for
our students. The objectives are to teach cadets life skills while instilling
the values of discipline and togetherness in the Uniformed Group.</p>
