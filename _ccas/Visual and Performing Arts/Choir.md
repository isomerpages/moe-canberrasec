<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Our choir enables students, from beginners to advanced musicians, to learn
and apply vocal and choral techniques. Through personal and creative expression
in individual, small group, and large group performances, we build students'
self-confidence and leadership potential. We are committed to fostering
a supportive and enriching environment where every member can grow musically
and personally, contributing positively to the community.</p>
<h4>2025 Highlights and Achievements</h4>
<p>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation</p>
<p>On 22 April 2025, the Canberra Secondary School Choir participated in
the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. The choir performed a diverse
repertoire — <em>What Is That I Hear?, Tres Canciones de Los Elementos, and Aya Ngena</em> —
showcasing their musical growth, teamwork, and passion. Their dedication
earned them a Certificate of Accomplishment, marking a proud milestone
in their artistic journey.</p>
<p>Student Reflection:</p>
<p>"Participating in this year's SYF choir presentation was an unforgettable
and enriching experience for me. After months of hard work and rehearsals
that shaped our sound, we were proud to receive the Certificate of Accomplishment
— an achievement I never imagined we could reach. Standing on stage with
my fellow choir members, I felt a surge of confidence and a deep sense
of unity as our voices blended in harmony. This journey taught me the value
of perseverance, teamwork, and attention to detail. Despite moments of
doubt and fatigue, the joy and satisfaction of performing at our best made
it all worthwhile. Beyond improving my musical skills, this experience
gave me lasting memories and friendships I will always treasure."</p>
