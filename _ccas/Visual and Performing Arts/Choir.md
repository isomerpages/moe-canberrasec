<h4>2025 Highlights and Achievements</h4>

<p>Student Reflection:</p>
<p><em>"Participating in this year's SYF choir presentation was an unforgettable and enriching experience for me. After months of hard work and rehearsals that shaped our sound, we were proud to receive the Certificate of Accomplishment — an achievement I never imagined we could reach. Standing on stage with my fellow choir members, I felt a surge of confidence and a deep sense of unity as our voices blended in harmony. This journey taught me the value of perseverance, teamwork, and attention to detail. Despite moments of doubt and fatigue, the joy and satisfaction of performing at our best made it all worthwhile. Beyond improving my musical skills, this experience gave me lasting memories and friendships I will always treasure."</em>
