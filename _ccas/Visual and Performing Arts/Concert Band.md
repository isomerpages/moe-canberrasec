<h4><strong>School Performances</strong></h4>
<p>The band plays an important role in bringing life and pride to school
events such as the National Day Parade and School Open House, where members
perform lively marches and upbeat tunes to celebrate and inspire the school
community. These performances also encourage fellow students to join and
experience the fun and fulfilment of being part of a band.</p>

<h4><strong>Leadership Development</strong></h4>
<p>Beyond performances, four student leaders attended the Youth Arts Leaders
Conference 2025, where they gained valuable knowledge in leadership, band
management, and musicianship. They have since applied what they learned
to support and uplift the band's growth.</p>
<h4><strong>Community Engagement</strong></h4>
<p>The band also takes part in music exchanges with groups such as the Sembawang
Wind Orchestra and Hougang Secondary School Band, fostering friendships
and sharing the joy of music-making. In addition, members participate in
the Sports Elective Programme — including Bowling and Air Pistol — which
nurtures teamwork, patience, and focus, qualities that strengthen them
both as musicians and as individuals.</p>
