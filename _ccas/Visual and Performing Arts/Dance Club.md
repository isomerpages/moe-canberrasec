<h4><strong>Vision and Mission:</strong></h4>
<p>
<br>The Canberra Secondary School Dance Club aims to inculcate in our dancers
a love for performance arts, a spirit of teamwork and responsibility as
well as commitment to whatever they do. Through dance, the values of group
work, mutual respect, tolerance and continuous progress towards perfection
are inculcated.</p>
<p>The Dance Club also aims to provide dancers with opportunities to stretch
their potentials beyond dance. For example, Canberran dancers learnt to
set higher expectations of themselves when they realise that there dancing
is more than the simple execution of movements. They also learnt to touch
the hearts of the audience as they put in their emotions into every steps
of the choreography.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our dancers demonstrated gratitude and respect for the opportunities to
participate in the Singapore Youth Festival 2023, Challenge Cup 2023 and
Muara Festival 2023 as observed by their keen and humble attitude in receiving
feedback and towards self-improvement.</p>
<p>They are grateful for all the support given by their family, teachers,
instructors and school-mates throughout the SYF and competition journey.</p>
<p>Embracing the values of being a compassionate Canberran, the dancers also
performed for Canberra Community Chinese New Year Dinner function on 23<sup>rd</sup> February
2024 and served the community via the ‘Elderly Befriending’ programme.</p>
<p>Through the programmes, they learnt to develop respect and compassion
for the elderly. They also learnt to be more grateful for the care that
their parents have rendered for them for the past 13-16 years of their
lives.</p>
<p>All in all, the holistic CCA experience has not only made them more bonded
together and passionate about dance and culture, but also made them disciplined
and resilient individuals.</p>
