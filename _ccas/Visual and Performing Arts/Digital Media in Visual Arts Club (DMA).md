<p><strong>Vision:</strong>
<br>The Digital Media in Visual Arts Club (DMA) aims to grow every Digital
Media Designer into a competent individual with a creative mind to create
and appreciate art. We strive to nurture lifelong learners with a heart
to serve the community.</p>
<p><strong>Focus Areas:</strong>
<br>In the DMA, we concentrate on three main areas: digital illustration,
photography, and videography. Our students delve into the world of digital
art, mastering tools and techniques to create stunning illustrations. They
use a variety of industry-standard tools and software, including Photoshop,
Procreate, and Adobe After Effects, to develop professional-quality digital
media content and enhance their technical skills.</p>
<p>Students are trained to capture compelling images using DSLR (EOS) and
mirrorless (EOS) cameras, honing both their technical skills and artistic
vision. Additionally, they learn to produce engaging videos, from storyboarding
and filming to editing and post-production.</p>
<p>In addition to their artistic pursuits, DMA members volunteer at the Sunlove
Senior Activity Centre. They plan and conduct art-related activities to
befriend and engage the seniors, enriching the lives of both the students
and the elderly participants.</p>

<p><strong>Opportunities:</strong>
<br>Members of DMA have numerous opportunities to enhance their skills and
gain real-world experience. They can serve as official student photographers
at the Singapore Youth Festival Celebrations and participate in various
digital media competitions. This year, they get to observe the behind-the-scenes
filming for a CNA documentary. Every student in the club grows their e-portfolio
through works done during regular CCA training sessions and competitions.
This year, our upper secondary students participated in the Singapore Polytechnic
MAD Grad Experience, where they learned to improve their e-portfolios for
admission to the media and design course at the polytechnic.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journeys:</strong>
<br>Our students have the opportunity to go on multiple learning journeys,
including visits to the Singapore Botanic Gardens and the ArtScience Museum
for photography sessions and to learn about immersive technology. These
excursions allow students to apply their skills in real-world settings
and gain inspiration from their surroundings.</p>

<br><strong>Julian from class 4 Diligence’24, shares his experience:</strong>
<br><em>"My experience in DMA is one that I cherish and appreciate deeply. During my time in this CCA, I’ve made many friends and precious memories. I had a lot of fun with the people I’ve met in DMA, just by working or talking with them. This CCA allowed me to connect with people with similar interests and hobbies as well as further develop and broaden my own interests. I came to this CCA with a strong interest in drawing, however, I ended up learning so much more. I’ve learned how to use several software like Photoshop, Premiere, and After Effects, as well as how to operate and set up professional cameras and tripods. Thanks to this CCA I’ve been given many opportunities to participate and even win in several art and film competitions and be a part of several film projects with my friends. This CCA has allowed me to make close friends, learn new skills, and take part in new and exciting opportunities. I sincerely hope that DMA would be as meaningful to others as it was to me. I feel that DMA is something truly special and I hope many more people can experience it."</em>
