<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>The Canberra Secondary School Guzheng Ensemble is an established CCA Performing
Arts Group dedicated to fostering music appreciation and performance skills
among our Canberrans. Our ensemble equips members with skills and techniques
to perform in various competitions, school events, music exchanges, and
community gatherings.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being a multi-racial and multi-national group, welcoming
Canberrans of different races and nationalities who share an interest in
Chinese musical instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Our Canberrans</strong> demonstrated exceptional dedication in
preparing for the 2025 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. Through
rigorous training sessions, they achieved the Certificate of Accomplishment
for their performance while strengthening their camaraderie as they worked
towards a shared goal.</p>
<p>“I am proud to have represented Canberra in two SYF performances both
in 2023 and this year.”</p>
<p>--- Lee Yi Xuan Michelle (4 Empathy)</p>
<p>“I am proud to have represented the School together with my fellow Guzheng
Ensemble members even though I am also sad because this is my only opportunity
to perform at the SYF as it is only held every two years. We have worked
hard to achieve the outcome and we have embraced our performance both as
individuals and as a team.”</p>
<p>--- Lim Xin Yi (3 Integrity), Chairperson of the Guzheng Ensemble 2025</p>
