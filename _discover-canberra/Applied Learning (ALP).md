<p>Canberra Secondary School ALP on Visual Arts and Design (VAD) is repositioned from our past strength in Digital Media. It is aligned to 21st Century Competencies Framework and to realise the vision of Every Canberran a Self-Directed Learner. We see VAD as a form of Aesthetics that helps our students to strike a balance between technical skills mastery with appreciation for the arts thus helping them in their holistic development. Our ALP incorporates learning in authentic setting, increased focus, alignment and integration as well as experiences and exposure to career prospects in VAD. The exposure in depth and breadth gives our students the opportunity to identify their aptitudes and interests, build their strengths, and make informed decisions on their education and career choices.</p>
<p>ALP is the Integration of Art curriculum and ICT curriculum which is inclusive of 2 tiers - Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 2 plus.</p>
<p>The 1st Tier is acquisition of knowledge and its pervasive learning through all level. The secondary 1 Visual Art curriculum looks into preparing students with visual aesthetics and digital media skills.</p>
<p>The secondary 2 Visual Art curriculum looks into equipping students with visual aesthetics and digital media skills. Besides having all sec 1 and 2 students undergo ALP curriculum, we also have our sec 3, 4 &amp; 5 Artist-students (students who select Art as an elective in upper sec) coming on board in this programme. This group of upper sec students will use the knowledge that they had learnt in lower sec and apply in their Art curriculum.</p>
<p>In Tier 2, students will be considered as specialist and will focus on the application of skills. This group of students will be identified from sec 1, those who have been scoring well for both Art and ICT curriculum will be offered to join&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>igital&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>edia in Visual&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>rts (DMA) club. They will therefore undergo deeper engagement in digital media through visual art.</p>
<p>For tier 2 plus, we call it Mastery because this group of students from DMA club will initiate personal project that is related to what they had learnt.</p>
