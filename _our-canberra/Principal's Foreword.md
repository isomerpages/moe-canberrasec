Happy New Year and a warm welcome to you and family to the Canberran Community. I would like to place on record our appreciation to Principal Mr Ng Tiong Nam for his leadership at Canberra Secondary (2017 â€“ 2022) and wish him all the best as he assumes his new appointment from 2023 as Principal, Broadrick Secondary School. I am honoured to join Canberra Secondary as its fifth Principal and I look forward to working in partnership with all parents/guardians as we nurture our students to be Grateful, Respectful and Compassionate Canberrans.

Thank you.

Mr Leong Kok Kee<br>
Principal
