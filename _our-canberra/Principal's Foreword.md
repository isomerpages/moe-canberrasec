<h3>The current predicament</h3>
<div>
<p>Since 2020, the rampant spread of Covid-19 around the world has led to the tragic deaths of millions worldwide. This pandemic has accentuated the profound negative impact that a small minority of people who are&nbsp;<strong><u>U</u>ngrateful,&nbsp;<u>D</u>isrespectful and&nbsp;<u>I</u>ndifferent (UDI)</strong> can have on society as a whole. This is manifested in the increase in domestic violence, online or verbal abuse, and blatant disregard for the safe distancing measures.</p>
<p>When we examine the UDI virus further, we definitely can discern the far wider implication of the UDI virus than the current pandemic situation. This UDI virus is present in all strata of society &ndash; whether rich or poor, young or old. It exists in our every word of complaint and every thoughtless action. It has directly or indirectly caused the deaths by traffic accidents, starvation, and global warming at an unprecedented level.</p>
</div>

<h3>What can we do to fight the UDI virus?</h3>
<p>We believe that&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">GRC</span>&nbsp;education</strong> is the best vaccine for UDI virus.</p>
<h3>What is GRC education?</h3>
<div>
<div>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>GRC</strong></span>&nbsp;<strong>education</strong>&nbsp;is a school-based curriculum designed to inculcate in our youth the timeless values of&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Gratitude, Respect and Compassion</strong>.</span> Through a four-year developmental&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>GRC</strong>&nbsp;</span><strong>GEMS</strong>&nbsp;total curriculum, we empower our youth to dare to challenge and conquer the three mega trends or as we call them,&nbsp;<strong>the three monsters</strong>. These monsters refer to :</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>1. Instant Gratification</strong></td>
<td><strong>(I Want it Now)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2. Consumerism</strong></td>
<td><strong>(Give me what I Want)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>3. Personal Glory</strong></td>
<td><strong>(I Want it for Myself)</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<p>Through a series of developmental&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>GRC&nbsp;</strong></span>signature programmes with various strategic community partners, we create authentic platforms for students and teachers to learn and demonstrate&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>GRC&nbsp;</strong></span>values by serving the real needs of their community on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The key&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>GRC&nbsp;</strong></span>strategies are as follows :</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>2:168 Contributor</strong>
<div>Everyone commits 2 hours in a week of 168 hours to serve the community</div>
</li>
<li>
<div><strong>Say "YES" to 3G Volunteerism</strong></div>
<div><strong>3 Generations&nbsp;</strong>, consisting of&nbsp;<strong><u>Y</u></strong>outh,&nbsp;<strong><u>E</u></strong>ducators and&nbsp;<strong><u>S</u></strong>eniors, serve as one team.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>They leverage on one another&rsquo;s strengths as evident in&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Y</strong>outh with&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>nergy<br /><strong>E</strong>ducators with&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xpertise<br /><strong>S</strong>eniors with&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xperience</div>
