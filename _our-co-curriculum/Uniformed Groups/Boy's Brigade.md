<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>The focus of the Boys&rsquo; Brigade (BB) is on mentoring and coaching our members in character building, leadership development, and service to the community. Many pivotal events are organised to inculcate these important values in our cadets. These include the Young Warriors Camp, The Empowerment Camp, Adventure Camp, BB CARES, BB Character Quest, and BB Share-a-Gift.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>For our efforts in the Assessment Year of 2017, we received the JM Fraser Award for Excellence (Silver). As in previous years, our Company also groomed outstanding Boys who have attained the highest rank (Warrant Officer). Warrant Officer Denny Yusoff B Zailani and Warrant Officer Jovan Tan Jia Wen were deserving recipients.</p>
