<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>The National Cadet Corps&rsquo; mission is to develop resourceful, responsible, resilient, loyal leaders and team players through fun and challenging military-related activities. We use the &ldquo;Cadet Strong&rdquo; framework: An NCC Cadet is &ldquo;Cadet Strong&rdquo;, with a resilient mind, fit body and committed heart.</p>
<p>Our activities include regular training, marksmanship, water activities like kayaking, adventure training as well as various competitions and programmes organised by NCC HQ.</p>
<p>Through our programmes and activities, we aim to inculcate values of loyalty to our country, uprightness, leadership, discipline, commitment and responsibility, care for fellow cadets, and an&nbsp;adventurous spirit in our cadets who we seek to develop into strong cadets.</p>
