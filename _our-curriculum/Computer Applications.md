<p>The Computer Applications (CPA) department is committed to empowering
students with a comprehensive understanding of computing concepts, proficiency
in a range of application software, and expertise in computational thinking
and problem-solving. We prioritize the responsible use of technology in
everyday life, ensuring students are well-equipped for the digital age.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPA curriculum encompasses a broad spectrum of IT skills and tools,
aligning with Baseline ICT Skill areas in word processing, spreadsheet,
multimedia, animation, and game-making. Teachers employ diverse pedagogical
approaches, including visible thinking strategies through the Student Learning
Space (SLS), to assess student understanding and facilitate deeper learning.</p>

<p>Lessons are intentionally designed to incorporate authentic tasks that
mirror real-world scenarios, allowing students to apply their learning
in meaningful ways. Through these tasks, students not only deepen their
technical understanding but also develop important values such as gratitude,
respect, and compassion through structured reflections.</p>

<p>Students engage in both self-directed and collaborative activities, developing
essential skills in a supportive environment. Coursework projects integrate
multiple software applications, allowing students to enhance their practical
skills and creativity. Outstanding student work is selected for participation
in the annual Media Computing competition organized by MOE Curriculum Planning
and Development Division, recognizing the dedication and talent of our
students.</p>
