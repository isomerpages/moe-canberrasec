<p><strong>Design and Technology@ Canberra Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Vision:</strong> Our vision is to inspire and nurture confident
and creative Future-Ready Canberrans</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> Our mission is to provide a safe and creative
learning environment that empowers our students to achieve cognitive excellence,
digital competencies, and technological knowledge and skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>In the lower secondary years, we offer an integrated approach to design
thinking using technology in our Secondary 1 and 2 Design &amp; Technology
(D&amp;T) curriculum. In Secondary 1, students are introduced to D&amp;T
design thinking and eSketching to bring their prototypes to life. Building
on this foundation, in Secondary 2, students are encouraged to apply their
design thinking knowledge and skills alongside eSketching to develop authentic
ideas and bring their prototypes to fruition. This approach equips our
students with the knowledge, skills, and mindset to innovate and create
in the ever-evolving technological landscape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>When students reach the upper secondary level, our D&amp;T students will
be able to seamlessly apply the design thinking knowledge and skills honed
in the lower secondary curriculum. Leveraging their knowledge in eSketch
and other technological skills acquired in earlier years, our upper secondary
D&amp;T students are competent and self-directed learners who display adaptive
and inventive thinking skills, in line with the enhanced 21st-century (21CC)
competency framework. This holistic approach not only fosters innovation
and creativity but also prepares our students to thrive in an increasingly
technology-driven world.</p>

<p><strong>Special Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students will have opportunities to embark on captivating projects
such as building catapults and bridges using popsicle sticks. These engaging
activities not only allow them to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical
setting but also foster creativity, critical thinking, and teamwork. Through
these dynamic projects, students hone their problem-solving skills, collaborate
in teams, and gain a deeper appreciation for the practical applications
of engineering.</p>
