<p>We believe in using engaging activities and programmes to motivate students
to excel in English Language and Literature, fostering a love for these
subjects. At Canberra, we offer a myriad of interesting activities and
programmes to enhance our students’ language abilities and cultivate their
interest in the language. Our students participate in various activities
designed to prepare them to be effective communicators who read widely
and think creatively and critically.</p>

<p>Beyond traditional pen-and-paper assessments and assignments, we incorporate
alternative forms of assessment involving ICT tools. Students have rich
opportunities to apply their language learning in authentic, real-world
tasks through performance tasks and projects. To develop fluency in writing
and a reflective mindset, students engage in journal writing and maintain
writing portfolios. All Lower Secondary students participate in a speech
and drama programme to build greater confidence in projecting their voice
and using body language effectively.</p>

<p>Our Literature programme is equally exciting, aiming to cultivate a keen
and critical appreciation of literature and literary language. Through
the study of literary texts across different genres (poetry, prose, and
drama) and written by a variety of authors (both local and international),
students learn to perceive the world from different perspectives and better
appreciate the richness of human experience. They also respond closely
and critically to writers’ use of literary techniques, gaining a deeper
understanding of the power and potential of language to challenge the mind
and move the heart.</p>
