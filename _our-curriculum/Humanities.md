<p><strong>Department Vision</strong>:</p>
<p>To nurture and develop Canberrans who are collaborative innovators and
compassionate leaders who aspire to become complex problem-solvers and
able to work collaboratively in designing innovative solutions, and values-driven
leaders with a heart to lead and serve others with compassion and empathy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aligning with our school's vision of "Nurturing Future Ready Canberrans,"
the Humanities Department is dedicated to fostering critical thinking about
global issues while cultivating a deep sense of empathy for our communities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We aim to spark curiosity in our students, encouraging them to explore
our VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world and understand
how communities interact. By nurturing and expanding this curiosity, we
help our students become well-rounded individuals who actively engage with
and positively contribute to the world around them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inquiry-based learning is central to our approach in teaching Humanities
at Canberra Secondary School. Through Geographical Investigation, Historical
Investigation, and Issues Investigation, we encourage students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Actively explore historical events, geographical phenomena, and social
issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask questions and conduct research</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critically analyze information</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students learn to formulate inquiries, seek answers through research,
and draw evidence-based conclusions. This approach deepens their understanding
of historical contexts, geographical landscapes, and societal complexities
while developing essential 21st-century skills such as critical thinking
and problem-solving.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the teaching and learning of humanities at Canberra, we integrate educational
technology purposefully: to augment existing instructional strategies,
modify tasks, and even redefine conventional way to teaching and learning
to empower students to take ownership of their learning, developing them
as active learners.</p>
<p>We leverage on online tools such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Student Learning Space (SLS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google Classroom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class Point</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Padlet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kahoot</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These platforms enrich classroom learning and facilitate class discussions,
encouraging active student participation. We also guide students in digitally
documenting their research and learning experiences, promoting digital
literacy and effective online research skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to equip students with the competencies to use their
Personal Learning Devices effectively and responsibly, fostering autonomous
learners with essential digital skills for lifelong learning beyond their
secondary education.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Canberra Secondary School's Humanities Department, we are committed
to the holistic growth of our students, continuously exploring new platforms
and methodologies to enhance their learning experience and prepare them
for the challenges of the future.</p>
