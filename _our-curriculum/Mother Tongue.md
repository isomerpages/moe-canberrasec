<h4><strong>At Canberra Secondary School, we believe in nurturing a deep appreciation for Mother Tongue Languages, recognizing their crucial role in connecting students with their cultural heritage and identity.</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Our vision is to cultivate a deep appreciation and love for Mother Tongue
Languages, nurturing students with a strong foundation and an enduring
interest in their cultural heritage.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Mission </strong></h4>
<p>We are committed to inspiring a love for Mother Tongue Languages through
cultural experiences and creative activities. Our goal is to help students
connect with their heritage, fostering a lifelong passion for language
and culture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To achieve this, we organised several programmes and activities in conjunction
with the MTL Fortnight, such as, Mass Story Book Borrowing with National
Library Board, Chinese traditional art and crafts workshop, creative writing
competition; Pena Emasku, Malay traditional arts like Boria and Dikir Barat,
making Malay traditional delicacies like Roti Kirai, Epok-epok and Ondeh-ondeh
and also learning how to eat communally by eating Nasi Ambeng together.</p>
<p>We also expose our students to the different cultures of our ethnic groups
through festive celebrations, such as Lunar New Year Celebrations, Hari
Raya Celebrations and Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>The school's first Chinese Language publication 'Kang Qing' was launched
in January 2014. This publication is a compilation of students daily written
works and reflections. The objectives of this publication are to provide
a platform to showcase students works, and to encourage students in learning
Chinese Language. From 2019, a joint publication will be produced together
with the ML Unit.</p>
<p>The MTL Department also believes that for a child to appreciate his Mother
Tongue Language, the best approach is through cultural exposure. Activities
such as performing arts and cultural games are organised for Secondary
one students as part of post-exam activities. Under the Cultural Performance
Exposure Scheme (文化随意门计划), our students enjoy watching Chinese language-related
cultural performances staged at public performing arts venue. In addition,
the Malay Language Unit was invited to put up an exhibition in conjunction
with Bulan Bahasa 2018, with the theme; ‘Pantang Nenek Moyang Aku’. The
main objective of this exhibition is to increase understanding and expose
the public to tips and taboos that exist in the Malay Community. We used
different platforms such as information boards, videos and interactive
game and quiz to share the information with the public. Our school ambassadors
had an enriching and fulfilling experience interaction with the public.</p>
