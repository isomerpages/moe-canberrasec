<h4>Department Vision:</h4>
<h4>Canberrans with the Knowledge, Skills and Attitude to lead a Physically Healthy and Active life.</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>About the Department:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&nbsp;“Intelligence and skill can only function at the peak of their capacity when the body is healthy and strong.”</em>
</p>

<p>We believe that every child should grow up knowing the hows and whys to
keep themselves fit and healthy. At Canberra, we teach a wide variety of
Sports and Games, so that our students are exposed to the different types
and genres of Sports around. Our students get to learn territorial-invasion,
net-wall as well as striking-fielding games. This exposure will help to
lay the foundation for a physically active and healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Movement is fundamental and essential to life, work and play. Our students
have the capacity to capitalise on their movement potential to lead productive
and fulfilling lives. Our PE Curriculum facilitates participation in physical
activities through which the individual discovers the joy of movement,
learns about themselves and their bodies, and develops the physical cognitive
and affective competencies that will contribute to their lifelong well-being.</p>
<p>Through the application of physical skills and games concepts across our
variety of authentic physical activities, students deepen their understanding
and enrich their performance capacity. Beyond the ability to perform physically,
we also expose our students to various individual and team environments,
which creates a variety of social and physical learning opportunities,
allowing students to build their social capacity, and their 21<sup>st</sup> Century
Competencies.</p>
<p>In our syllabus, our students go through a variety of Sports and Games.
Some of these include the following.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Secondary 1 – Netball and Badminton</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary 2 – Basketball, Ultimate Frisbee, Floorball</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary 3 – Touch Rugby, Softball, Volleyball</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary 4 – Football, Pickleball</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, students are exposed to the natural world around them through
our Outdoor Education curriculum. Students learn technical outdoor competencies
and skills, and learn to plan and apply risk assessment and management
in dynamic situations in the outdoors.&nbsp; Through self-directed learning
experiences in school and during Outdoor Adventure Cohort Camps in unfamiliar
environments, students are reinforced in their outdoor competencies. They
develop greater personal confidence, while deepening their understanding
of the places around them.</p>
<p>Through our Physical Health and Safety syllabus, we build on the understanding
of the importance of healthy eating, and the benefits of regular participation
in physical activities. This broadens the students’ repertoire of health
concepts and skills, and they are better able to make informed decisions,
contributing towards active and healthy living.</p>
