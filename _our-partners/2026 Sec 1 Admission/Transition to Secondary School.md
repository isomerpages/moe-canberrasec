<p>Students moving from Primary to Secondary School are entering a new phase
of life. They will be exposed to different challenges and it is crucial
to help your child/ward with the transition.</p>
<p><strong>Help your child/ward to understand the common challenges</strong>
</p>
<p>Some of the challenges faced by students entering Secondary School include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>New School environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New friends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New syllabus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New phase of life</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your child/ward has spent the last 6 years getting used to their Primary
School, and now they'll be going to a new school. Moreover, many of your
child’/ward's Primary School friends may be posted to different Secondary
Schools.</p>
<p>Meeting new people can be difficult, but it is also an opportunity for
them to form new, long-lasting friendships.</p>
<p>Your child/ward will also be learning new subjects, including Geography,
History, Literature, Food and Consumer Education, as well as Design and
Technology. There will also be more subject choices, especially in Upper
Secondary.</p>
<p>In this phase of school, your child/ward will enter their teenage years
and go through physical, emotional and mental changes. They will also begin
to explore the different pathways available for them to fulfil their dreams
and aspirations.</p>
<p><strong>Support your child’s development and interests</strong>
</p>
<p>It is important that you select a school where your child’s development
and interests will be supported. Generally, Secondary School students do
best when they:</p>

Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs).</p>

<p>Have teachers who care about them and cater to their needs.</p>
</li>

<p>Are able to enjoy the process of learning at an appropriate level for
them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Encourage your child to prepare for the transition</strong>
</p>
