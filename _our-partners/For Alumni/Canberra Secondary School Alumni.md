<p>The Canberran Alumni plays a vital role in enhancing the quality of education
at Canberra Secondary School. By collaborating with alumni, the school
leverages their resources and experiences to create more opportunities
for student development.</p>
<p>Our alumni have been exceptionally supportive of school activities. They've
contributed significantly to events such as Sports Fest and Good Health,
Great Living @ Canberra, serving as game officials and active participants.
In 2015, alumni members organized the Prom Night for graduating students
and were involved in major school events including Lunar New Year celebrations,
Sports Fest, and Canberran Nights.</p>
<p>The Alumni Association actively reaches out to recent graduates, aiming
to strengthen its membership and expand its impact. Through these efforts,
we aim to instill a lasting sense of belonging and pride in Canberra Secondary
School among all our graduates.</p>
