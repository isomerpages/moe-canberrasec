				<h5>We are thrilled to announce that our talented students have emerged as the CHAMPIONS of the Science Buskers Festival!</h5>
<img style="width:40%" src="/images/scibuskers2.jpg"><br>
The Science Department takes pride in our Talent Development Program. The programme identifies and nurtures young minds with a passion for science, providing them with advanced challenges, mentorship, and opportunities to participate in research projects while instilling the values found in scientists. Through this programme, we also aim to develop each Canberran’s communication skills through expressions of science in a creative manner. 
<br><br>
Our Secondary 1 and 2 students recently participated in the latest Science Buskers Festival; an annual competition organised by the Science Centre Singapore. This year, the competition was held physically at the Science Centre Singapore with nearly 400 participating teams across Singapore schools including Tertiary Institutions. At the competition, the participants did a "show-and-tell" on any science topic in creative and engaging manners.

The finalists did their busking live to both judges and the general public, on 28 and 29 October 2023 (Saturday and Sunday), from 9 am to 5 pm, at Seng Kang Grand Mall; and we are delighted to share that the finals of the Science Buskers Festival Competition was a remarkable success. With 50 teams representing primary schools, secondary schools, and tertiary institutions from across Singapore, the event was a true celebration of scientific enthusiasm and creativity. <br><br>
<img style="width:25%" src="/images/scibuskers1.jpg">
<br>
Both teams demonstrated exceptional dedication in their preparation, impressing both judges and the audience with their innovative and engaging performances. After two intense days of competition, our school's "Killipe" team emerged as CHAMPION in the secondary schools’ category. 
The Science Buskers Competition serves as a crucial platform for igniting a passion for science and honing effective communication skills. We take pride in representing our school at this event, and we believe this accomplishment will inspire more students to engage in science-related activities and initiatives.<br><br>
