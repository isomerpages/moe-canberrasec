<h4><strong>Direct School Admission (Background)</strong></h4>
<p>The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE’s move
towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec
Exercise, schools will be able to select a percentage of their students
for admission outside of the centralised posting system, via their own
selection criteria. Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools
wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind
the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes
available to develop the area of talent.</p>
