<p><strong>NIE Mathematics Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p>The NIE Mathematics Challenge is an annual competition organised by the
National Institute of Education, designed to stretch mathematical thinking
through non-routine problems that go beyond the school curriculum. The
challenge encourages creativity, logical reasoning, and perseverance in
problem-solving. Several of our students rose to this challenge, with a
number achieving High Distinction and Distinction Awards.</p>
<p>Well done Canberrans, for your exceptional mathematical prowess. To all
our budding mathematicians: don't shy away from challenging problems that
seem impossible at first glance. Every complex equation you tackle, every
creative solution you discover, strengthens your analytical thinking. Mathematics
is not just about getting the right answer—it's about developing the resilience
to keep trying when the path isn't clear.</p>

<p><strong>Junior Chef Culinary Competition</strong>
</p>
<p>At Republic Polytechnic's Junior Chef Culinary Competition, finalists
from top schools showcased their culinary artistry. Xanneth and Afie from
Sec 3 Respect proudly represented Canberra Secondary, crafting their innovative
take on the Awesome Pedas burger. While they didn't place in the top three,
these aspiring chefs gained invaluable experience working in an industrial-standard
kitchen. We applaud their creativity and determination in this competitive
culinary arena.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Xanneth and Afie show us that every experience is a stepping stone to
growth. To all Canberrans with creative passions: pursue what excites you,
even if the outcome is uncertain. Whether it's cooking, art, music, or
any other pursuit, the courage to try and the willingness to learn matter
more than winning. Your creativity and determination today build the foundation
for tomorrow's success.</p>

<br>The Singapore Green Plan 2030 is a nationwide sustainability movement
which aims to rally coordinated efforts to tackle climate change. It is
jointly led by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of National Development,
the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, the Ministry of Trade
and Industry and the Ministry of Transport. There are 5 main pillars under
the Green Plan which outline ambitious and concrete sustainability targets
to be achieved by 2030. The SGA supports the Green Plan by encouraging
participating schools to align their environmental projects with these
pillars. Through this, youths can make positive contributions to the national
agenda on sustainable development.</p>
