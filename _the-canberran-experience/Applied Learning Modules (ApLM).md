<p>ApLM@ITE / ApLM@Poly (previously known as Advanced Elective Modules -
AEM) are enrichment modules in applied areas that enhance the learning
experience of our Secondary 2 and 3 Canberrans. These modules provide our
students with rich applied learning opportunities â€“ learning that involves
doing and applying, learning about the real world, and learning for life.
These experience help Canberrans discover their strengths and interests,
experience ITE/polytechnic life, and expose them to possible post-secondary
courses and careers.</p>
