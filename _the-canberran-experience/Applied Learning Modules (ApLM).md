<p>ApLM@ITE / ApLM@Poly (previously known as Advanced Elective Modules -
AEM) are enrichment modules in applied areas that enhance the learning
experience of our Secondary 2 and 3 Canberrans. These modules provide our
students with rich applied learning opportunities â€“ learning that involves
doing and applying, learning about the real world, and learning for life.
These experiences help Canberrans discover their strengths and interests,
experience ITE/polytechnic life, and expose them to possible post-secondary
courses and careers.</p>

<p>In Canberra Secondary School, we are committed to providing a unique opportunity
for all Secondary 2 &amp; 3 NA/NT students to gain hands-on experience
at a post-secondary institution. This was made possible through Applied
Learning Modules (ApLM) offered at ITE. Our aim is to broaden the reach
of ApLM, ensuring that a wider range of students can benefit from enhanced
engagement and improved learning outcomes. Our primary objective is to
enrich the educational journey of students by facilitating their participation
in applied learning experiences at ITE. This strategic approach is designed
to complement their existing secondary school curriculum by emphasizing
the practical application of knowledge. We hope to empower our students
to explore their individual interests and strengths, equipping them to
make informed decisions about their educational paths and future careers.</p>
