<p><strong>Secondary 1 and 2 Science Buskers</strong>
</p>
<p>Each year, our students have the opportunity to take part in Science Buskers,
an annual competition organised by A*STAR and Science Centre Singapore.
&nbsp;The programme identifies and nurtures young minds with a passion
for science, providing them with advanced challenges, mentorship, and opportunities
to participate in research projects while instilling the values found in
scientists. Through this programme, we also aim to develop each Canberranâ€™s
communication skills through expressions of science in a creative manner.</p>

<p><strong>Conversational Chinese and Malay Language (CCM) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Conversational Chinese/Malay (CCM) Programme is an enrichment programme
offered to the Cohort 1 Canberrans. This programme enhances students' understanding
and appreciation of Singapore's diverse cultures. Through CCM lessons,
Canberrans have the opportunity to immerse themselves in conversational
Chinese or Malay, applying their skills in authentic, real-world situations.
This hands-on approach ensures that students not only learn the language
but also experience the cultural aspects first-hand. At the end of the
programme, Canberrans will be equipped with basic conversational skills
to enable them to interact with native speakers confidently.</p>
