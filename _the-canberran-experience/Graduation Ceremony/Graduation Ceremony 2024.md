<p>September 25, 2024 marks a significant milestone for Canberra Secondary
School as it organized the Graduation Ceremony for Cohort 4/5. The theme
for the ceremony was "Dare to Dream, Ready to Soar", symbolizing that the
students are ready to spread their wings and take on new challenges as
they graduate.</p>
<p>For the first time in Canberra's history, the graduating students donned
the traditional graduation gown, complete with a sash bearing the school
colors of red, blue, and green, as well as a mortar board. The students
were excited to receive their gowns and took great care to wash and iron
them in preparation for the occasion.</p>

<p>The ceremony was both meaningful and touching, filled with gratitude speeches
from class representatives, a photo montage chronicling the students' journey
since Secondary 1, and a moving performance by the school's Guitar Ensemble.
The 16 aspiring guitarists also performed a rendition of "Auld Lang Syne"
to honor their graduating peers.</p>

<p>The students were also presented with special gifts, including the Canberran
Graduation Bear, a 2024 keychain, and a Best-Luck pack. Additionally, the
Character Coaches customized gifts for their form classes to convey their
well-wishes and congratulations to the students, many of whom they had
been with since Secondary 1.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, the Principal, Mr Leong, and Year Head, Ms Frieda
Tay, reminded the students to continue pursuing excellence and to be guided
by their moral compass in making sound decisions that positively impact
the lives of others.</p>
<p>The event concluded with a sumptuous tea reception, where the students
chatted heartily as they enjoyed a wide spread of delicious dishes, including
chocolate eclairs, fried mee siam, and pineapple fried rice.</p>
<p>Canberra Secondary School believes that the students have formed fond
memories of their 4/5 year journey and will continue to live by the school's
motto, "I can, I will, I did it!"</p>
