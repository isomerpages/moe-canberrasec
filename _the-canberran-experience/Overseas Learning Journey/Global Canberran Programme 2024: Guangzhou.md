<p><strong><em>Day 2 (25 October 2024) -</em></strong>
</p>
<p>We had a ‘Shenzhen-paced’ day today. Noted for its efficiency and speed,
we visited Shen Zhen on high speed train. The visit to Shen Zhen Museum
was informative. The highlight for the day was the cultural performances
at Splendid China Folk Cultural Village. Our five senses were continuously
stimulated by the colourful costumes, ear-splitting explosions, synchronised
dance moves and theatrical displays.</p>

<p><strong><em>Day 3 (26 October 2024) -</em></strong>
</p>
<p>We put our creativity to the test with round fan painting today at Lingnan
Impression Park. We finally did some shopping as we had a walking tour
at Shamian Island, Yongqingfang and Shangxiajiu Pedestrain Street. We admired
the local streets - the old and the refurbished ones. There were also architectural
buildings built from the British, French and colonial influences. We ended
our day immersing in the splendid night scenery of Guangzhou on a night
cruise.</p>

<p><strong><em>Day 4 (27 October 2024) -</em></strong>
</p>
<p>A walk along Beijing Road kickstarted our day. Though it is a bustling
shopping district now, it was a thousand year old lane with remnants of
an ancient building. Next, we learnt how to make chinese pancake and how
to weave using a loom. Our patience was put to the test and we gained a
deeper respect for the ancient people for their wisdom and handicraft.</p>
