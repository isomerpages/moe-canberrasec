<h2>Global Canberran Programme 2024: Vietnam</h2>
<p>Selected Secondary 3 Canberrans participated in an enriching educational
journey to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from 24 to 29 October 2024 as part
of our Global Canberra Programme (GCP). This cultural exchange program
provided students with immersive learning experiences in one of Southeast
Asia's most dynamic cities.</p>

<p>GCP encourages students to critically engage with key topics such as community
engagement, cultural diversity, sustainability, and active citizenship.
By exploring these areas, the programme aims to strengthen students' commitment
to and rootedness in Singapore while broadening their global perspectives.</p>
