<h2>Overseas Learning Journey 2024: Johore-Malacca, Malaysia</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce Cohort 2's upcoming Overseas Learning Journey
(OLJ) to Johor-Malacca, Malaysia. There are 2 trips - Trip 1: 28-29 October
2024, Trip 2: 4-5 November 2024.</p>
<p>This enriching experience is designed to equip our Secondary 2 Canberrans
with 21st-Century competencies and develop them into effective leaders
of character.</p>
<h4>Programme Objectives</h4>
<h4>1. Cultural Exposure / Immersion</h4>
<p>To expose students to different cultures, fostering a deeper understanding
and appreciation of global diversity. This includes visits to heritage
sites, museums, and school visits, providing students with a practical
understanding of their academic subjects from an international perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Global Awareness / Perspectives</h4>
<p>To cultivate a global mindset, encouraging students to think beyond their
local context and understand global issues and their implications as well
as developing a sense of responsibility towards global issues.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Global Development</h4>
<p>To build independence, confidence, and self-reliance as students navigate
new environments and situations. This exposure helps to enhance their adaptability
and problem-solving skills, preparing them to face and overcome challenges
in unfamiliar settings.</p>
