<p>Selected Secondary 3 Canberrans participated in an enriching sustainability-focused
educational journey to Bali, Indonesia, from 28 to 31 May 2025. This overseas
learning journey provided our students with firsthand exposure to Bali's
rich cultural heritage and environmental conservation efforts, deepening
their appreciation for diverse traditions and sustainable practices.</p>

<p>The programme encouraged our Canberrans to explore environmental stewardship,
cultural preservation, and sustainable development through immersive learning
experiences. Students engaged with traditional agriculture, marine conservation
projects, and community-based sustainability initiatives, strengthening
their environmental consciousness while broadening their global perspectives.</p>
