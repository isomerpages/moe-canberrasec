<p>A group of 26 students and four teachers embarked on a meaningful learning
journey to Hainan, China, from 14 to 18 October 2025, with the goal of
participating in a school exchange and deepening their cultural immersion.
Through structured classroom interactions, collaborative activities, and
conversations with local peers, students gained first-hand insights into
China’s education system, learning practices, and school culture. Beyond
the academic exchange, they explored Hainan’s rich heritage through visits
to cultural landmarks, historical sites, and local communities. This experience
broadened their global awareness, enhanced cross-cultural communication
skills, and nurtured an appreciation for diverse perspectives. Students
returned with greater confidence, independence, and valuable international
friendships that enriched their personal and academic growth.</p>
