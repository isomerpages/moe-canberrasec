<p>The Canberran Overseas Learning Journey is an overseas learning initiative
designed to equip our students with 21st-century competencies and shape
them into effective leaders of character.</p>
<p>Through this programme, students are nurtured to become confident and
competent global citizens, adept in navigating and appreciating diverse
cultures. OLJ prepares our students for meaningful engagement with local
communities in Singapore and across the ASEAN region, fostering a deeper
understanding of both global and regional issues.</p>
