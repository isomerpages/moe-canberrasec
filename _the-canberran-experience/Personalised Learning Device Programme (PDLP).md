<p>MOE has rolled out a Personal Learning Device (PLD) Initiative that requires
every secondary student to have access to his/her own Personal Learning
Device (PLD). The aims are to enhance teaching and learning, support development
of self-directedness, collaborative skills and digital literacies.</p>
<p>With the implementation of the MOE Student Learning Space (SLS) for all
schools, students can also use their PLDs to access rich resources that
are available in the portal to support their own learning anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>The school's prescribed PLD is the iPad 10.9 (10th generation) that all
Secondary 1 students should acquire as their PLD in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More details on procurement, funding and other administrative matters
will be provided to the 2024 Secondary 1 parents in early January 2024.</p>
