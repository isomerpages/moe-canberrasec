<h4><strong>Student Leadership Development Framework</strong></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Student_Leadership_Development_Framework.png">
</div>
<p>In Canberra Secondary School, we implement a three-tiered Student Leaders
Framework in the form of a pyramid, designed to cultivate comprehensive
leadership skills among our Canberrans.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1: Personal Leadership</strong>
</p>
<p>At the base of the pyramid, all Secondary 1 to 3 students are introduced
to basic leadership principles through the Leadership Challenge Model.
Class leaders are chosen to guide their peers and develop their leadership
abilities. These leaders play a crucial role in fostering a positive class
atmosphere and participate actively in school-wide projects such as the
Cheer Competition and the YOLO project, promoting unity and teamwork.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 2: Team Leadership</strong>
</p>
<p>The next level of the pyramid focuses on Team Leadership, where Co-Curricular
Activity (CCA) leaders collaborate to guide their teams towards achieving
shared goals. These leaders also engage in synergistic projects, coordinated
by the Student Leadership Committee, to enrich the school experience. Uniformed
Group Student Leaders lead and organize events like the Sports Fest, National
Day Parade, and Kids Read @ North Oaks Primary School.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 3: Servant Leadership (Stewardship)</strong>
</p>
<p>At the apex of the pyramid is Servant Leadership, where Student Council
members act as Community Youth Leaders, engaging in initiatives that have
a positive impact on the school and the broader community. The Student
Council Executive Committee Members participate in advanced leadership
development programs, such as the Student Leaders Network organized by
Hwa Chong Institution and the Fit to Lead Programme by Republic Polytechnic.
These experiences further enhance their leadership skills, enabling them
to serve as effective ambassadors for the school community. They represent
their peers and lead various initiatives, including the Student Suggestion
Scheme, the Canberran Soundtrack, and the Canberran Spotlight, all aimed
at enhancing the overall student experience in Canberra.</p>
<p>This three-tiered Student Leaders Framework ensures that all students
have opportunities to develop and apply their leadership skills, preparing
them to be responsible and engaged Community Youth Leaders.</p>
