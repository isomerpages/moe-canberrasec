<p>The Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) is an aptitude-based admissions exercise
which allows students to apply for and receive conditional offers for admission
prior to their GCE Examinations. Students applying through the Polytechnic
EAE are considered for admission based on demonstrated aptitude and passion,
beyond just academic grades. Schools will also consider students' experience
and achievements in sports, arts, leadership, entrepreneurship and community
service.</p>
