<p>To enhance the resilience and tenacity of our graduating students, our
school organized a 3-day workshop conducted by High Achiever Academy. Our
graduating Canberrans learned effective study habits and picked up tips
on working independently and in groups.</p>
<p>In line with our school's mission to nurture Future-Ready Canberrans,
our students participated in a course advisory attachment at Nanyang Polytechnic
(NYP). This experience gave them a glimpse of campus life and NYP's unique
polytechnic education approach.</p>
