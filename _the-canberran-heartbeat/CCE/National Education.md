<p>Calendared National Education (NE) Events provide timely platforms for
developing various citizenship attitudes desired in our students. These
events include commemorations such as Total Defence Day and Racial Harmony
Day, National Day celebration, learning journeys and ceremonies like the
issuance of National Registration Identity Card (NRIC). These activities
are integral to our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum,
fostering a deeper understanding of Singapore's history, values, and the
importance of unity and resilience.</p>
<p><strong>Total Defence Day</strong>
</p>
<p>This year marked the 40th anniversary of Total Defence in Singapore. Our
school commemorated this significant milestone on 15th February by participating
in the Food Resilience Experience. Through a CCE lesson and a ready-to-eat
meal provided by the Singapore Food Agency, students learned about food
disruption and the importance of food resilience during crises. This activity
emphasised the six pillars of Total Defence—Military, Civil, Economic,
Social, Digital, and Psychological Defence—and highlighted the collective
role of every Singaporean in keeping our nation strong and resilient.</p>

<p><strong>Racial Harmony Day Celebration</strong>
</p>
<p>Racial Harmony Day is a vital part of our National Education programme,
celebrated annually to promote social cohesion and mutual respect among
our diverse student body. This year, our celebration included a cultural
performance by Guinness World Record Holder for Non-Stop 50 Hours Drumming,
Rhythm Masala. The performance featured multiethnic music, a demonstration
of various percussion instruments, and interactive segments involving students
and teachers. Staff and students came dressed in their ethnic costumes
to foster a sense of unity and cultural appreciation.</p>
<p>Additionally, a CCE lesson on racial harmony was also conducted, engaging
students in interactive lessons through the Student Learning Space (SLS)
and ST IN platforms.&nbsp; These activities reinforced the importance of
harmony and understanding in maintaining Singapore's social fabric.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journey to the National Museum of Singapore</strong>
</p>
<p>In March, our Secondary 2 students embarked on a learning journey to the
National Museum of Singapore as part of the "Artefactually Speaking" programme.
This museum-based learning experience, guided by specially-trained educators,
allowed students to explore various artefacts and make personal connections
with Singapore's history. The "Artefactually Speaking" programme encourages
students to engage deeply with historical objects, fostering critical thinking
and historical empathy. The journey through the Singapore History Gallery
and other exhibits deepened their appreciation for the nation's heritage
and the stories of its people, places, and experiences.</p>

<p><strong>National Day Celebrations</strong>
</p>
<p>Our National Day celebration is always a highlight of the school year.
Each year, we celebrate Singapore's independence with a series of events
that included the observance ceremony, a CarniVIAl focused on educating
participants about active aging, and various student performances. The
celebration fostered a sense of national pride and unity, encouraging students
to reflect on Singapore's journey as a nation and their role in its future.</p>

<p>This year, our students can look forward to an exciting National Day celebration
with the theme "Onward As One," which promises to inspire and unite our
school community once again.</p>
<p><strong>NRIC Issuance Ceremony</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to fostering a sense of national identity, our
school holds an NRIC issuance ceremony for students. This significant event
marks a milestone in our students' lives, symbolising their responsibilities
and privileges as citizens of Singapore. The ceremony instils a sense of
pride and responsibility, encouraging students to contribute positively
to their community and nation.</p>
