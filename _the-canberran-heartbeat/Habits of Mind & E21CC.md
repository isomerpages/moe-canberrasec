<p><strong>Unlock Your Potential with Habits of Mind (HOM)</strong>
</p>
<p>At Canberra, we believe in preparing students not just for exams, but
for life. Habits of Mind (HOM) is a program that empowers students to think
critically, creatively, and wisely, especially when faced with challenges
or unfamiliar situations. These essential skills equip our students for
the complexities of the 21st century, nurturing a love for learning that
extends beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Through HOM, students develop strong learning habits and thoughtful dispositions,
enabling them to become self-directed, lifelong learners. This program
is designed for every student, regardless of academic level or stream,
because we believe that the ability to think and learn effectively is key
to success for all.</p>
