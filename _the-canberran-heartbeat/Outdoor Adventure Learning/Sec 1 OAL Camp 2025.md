<p>The Secondary 1 Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp facilitated smoother primary-to-secondary
transition by enabling students to forge meaningful peer connections whilst
developing confidence. Through diverse team-bonding and outdoor activities,
students created memorable experiences and extended classroom learning.
The camp cultivated socio-emotional competences, leadership skills, teacher-peer
relationships, positive class environments, and cultivated a spirit of
adventure and resilience.</p>
