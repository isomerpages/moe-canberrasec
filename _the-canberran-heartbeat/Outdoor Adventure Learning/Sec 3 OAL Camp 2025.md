<p>To nurture our Secondary 3 Canberrans into resilient and confident individuals,
they undertook a four-day, three-night adventure camp featuring team-building
games, low-element challenges, outdoor cooking, dragon boating, navigation
hikes, and reflective sessions. The camp cultivated socio-emotional competences,
leadership skills, peer relationships, and a spirit of adventure whilst
building a positive, supportive class environment.</p>
