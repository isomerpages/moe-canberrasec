<h4>Secondary 3 Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp: 4 March - 7 March 2024</h4>
<p>The Secondary Three Adventure Camp is organized to nurture resilience
and confidence in our students. This 4-day-3-night overnight camp provides
our Sec 3 Canberrans with challenging experiences to develop their character
and teamwork skills. Through a variety of exciting activities including
team-building games, low-element challenges, outdoor cooking, and a navigation
hike through north-eastern Singapore, our students push their limits while
fostering camaraderie and self-reliance.</p>
