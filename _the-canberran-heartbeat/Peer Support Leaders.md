<p><strong>Peer Support Relations (PSR) at Canberra Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Vision: To create an enabling and caring environment where students
feel safe, accepted, empowered, and competent through strong positive peer
relationships.</p>
<p>Our PSR structure aligns with the Ministry of Education's PSR framework,
where students participate in fostering strong friendships and a sense
of belonging to the school community (peer bonding), provide practical
help and social-emotional support to one another (peer helping) and promote
positive mindsets, pro-social behaviours (both online and offline), well-being
and role model good character (peer influencing) <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/secondary/syllabuses/cce/2021-character-and-citizenship-education-syllabus-secondary.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">(CCE Student Development Curriculum Division, 2020)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) are selected students who take on a more active
role in supporting their peers. Their responsibilities include monthly
training sessions where they develop skills to listen actively, respond
with empathy, manage conflicts, encourage early help-seeking and positive
coping strategies.&nbsp;Beyond that, PSLs are also involved in various
school-wide activities to enhance peer bonding within classes and the school
community.</p>
<p>In summary, the role of PSLs in Canberra Secondary School is to bond with,
help, and positively influence their peers, thereby contributing to an
enabling and caring environment.</p>
