<p>Students moving from Primary to Secondary School are entering a new phase
of life. They will be exposed to different challenges and it is crucial
to help your child with the transition.</p>
<p><strong>Help your child to understand the common challenges</strong>
</p>
<p>Some of the challenges faced by students entering Secondary School include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>New School environment (ie. timing and peers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New subject syllabus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New phase of life</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your child has spent the last 6 years getting used to their Primary School,
and now they will be going to a new school. Moreover, many of your child’s
Primary School friends may be posted to different Secondary Schools.</p>
<p>Meeting new people can be difficult, but it is also an opportunity for
them to form new, long-lasting friendships.</p>
<p>Your child will also be learning new subjects, including Geography, History,
Literature, Food and Consumer Education, as well as Design and Technology.
There will also be more subject choices, especially in Upper Secondary.</p>
<p>In this phase of school, your child will enter their teenage years and
go through physical, emotional and mental changes. They will also begin
to explore the different pathways available for them to fulfil their dreams
and aspirations.</p>
<p><strong>Support your child’s development and interests</strong>
</p>
<p>It is important that you select a school where your child’s development
and interests will be supported. Generally, Secondary School students do
best when they:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Feel a sense of belonging, with their friends and at the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feel a sense of purpose and progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the opportunity to contribute to the school, for example through their
Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find their interests and explore new experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have teachers who care about them and cater to their needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are able to enjoy the process of learning at an appropriate level for
them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Encourage your child to prepare for the transition</strong>
</p>
<p>When discussing these challenges with your child, encourage them to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Choose subjects and electives that interest them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look beyond academics and pursue activities that excite them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make new friends and involve themselves in sports, games, clubs and other
CCAs. They get the opportunity to find their interests and learn new things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let you know if they are having challenges in school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
