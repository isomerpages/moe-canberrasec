<h4><strong>Student Recognition @ Canberra</strong></h4>
<p>At Canberra Secondary School, our student recognition processes are integral
to our mission of "Growing Minds, Glowing Hearts." We have developed a
comprehensive range of internal and external awards designed to acknowledge
both cognitive and character excellence. These processes aim to motivate
our students, celebrate their achievements, and foster a culture of continuous
improvement.</p>
<h4><strong>Internal Awards/Recognition</strong></h4>

focus on academic achievements and intellectual growth:</p>
