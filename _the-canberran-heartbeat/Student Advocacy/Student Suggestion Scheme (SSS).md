<h4><strong>Students’ Advocacy @ Canberra Secondary School – Students’ Suggestion Scheme (SSS)</strong></h4>
<p>At Canberra Secondary School, we recognize the immense value of students'
voices and place a strong focus on nurturing proactive leaders. Our Student
Suggestion Scheme is a key initiative that encourages students to share
their ideas for enhancing the school community. This scheme not only empowers
students but also promotes a sense of ownership and responsibility towards
their school environment and experiences.</p>
