<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>DSA-Sec is an admission exercise which provides students with the opportunity
to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of specific
academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate
beyond the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). The objective of
the DSA-Sec is to promote holistic education by giving participating schools
greater flexibility in selecting students while holding on to the key principles
of transparency and meritocracy. For students, the DSA provides them the
opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents
in seeking admission to secondary schools.</p>
<p>In Canberra Secondary School, staff and students alike are constantly
engaged in developing new ideas for the digital media in teaching and learning.
Our DSA talent area in Visual Art – Media Arts / Film / Photography, is
aligned with our Applied Learning Programme (Digital Media).. Through our
structured school-wide Applied Learning Programme (Digital Media), our
students are given a headstart in Digital Media. The programme incorporates
learning in authentic setting and integrates education and career experiences
for the students. The exposure in depth and breadth gives our students
the opportunity and skillsets to further their interests in Digital Media
related fields later in their education and career choices.</p>
<p>The school has vacancies for up to 20% of our Secondary 1 cohort in 2025
for the DSA-Sec programme. Interested students can apply through the DSA
process.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent.</p>
<p>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected
to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities
related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.</p>
