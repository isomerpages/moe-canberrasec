**For 4N1, 4N2, 4T1 and 4T2 Students  

You will be allowed to enter the school from 1.45pm onwards. Please be seated in the  school hall by 2.00pm. Parents/guardians may accompany their child/ward to school to  collect their results. 

You are to report to school in half uniform (school PE t-shirt and school pants/skirt).  Students are expected to be properly groomed in accordance to the school grooming  standards. 

If you are unwell or affected by COVID-19 restrictions (e.g. required to self-isolate due to  a positive COVID-19 test result), you should not return to school to collect your results.  You can view your results online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s  (SEAB) Candidates Portal at [www.seab.gov.sg](www.seab.gov.sg) from 2.45pm on Monday, 19 December  2022 till 11.59pm on Friday, 30 December 2022 using your SingPass. 

However, if you are unable to collect your results in person, you can appoint a proxy to  collect the results and form from the school on your behalf. The proxy will need to produce  a letter of authorisation from the candidate’s parents for school’s verification.
