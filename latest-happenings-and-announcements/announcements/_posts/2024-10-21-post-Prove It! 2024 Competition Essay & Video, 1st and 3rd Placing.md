<p>Over the past 4 months, our Secondary Two Canberrans have been participating
in two of National Library Board’s competitions, <strong>Historical Scene Investigation (HSI), </strong>and <strong>Prove It!</strong> Our
participants were selected via a qualifying process by assessing the quality
of the Secondary Two History cohort’s Historical Investigation projects.
They wrote an essay and created an eye-opening video that dives into the
importance of using digital devices wisely using credible research sources.
They also shared tips during the school assembly on how to evaluate online
sources using the "S.U.R.E framework.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2 teams of students took part in the HSI Competition and Prove It! Competition
respectively. Our HSI Teams achieved a Bronze and Silver award, while our
Prove It! Video Team finished as the Third Runner Up and our Prove It!
Essay Team emerged as Champions. Congratulations CANberrans!</p>
