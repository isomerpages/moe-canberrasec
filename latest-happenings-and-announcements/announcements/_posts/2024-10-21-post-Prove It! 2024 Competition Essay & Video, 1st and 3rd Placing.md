<p>Over the past four months, our Secondary Two Canberrans have participated
in two National Library Board competitions: Historical Scene Investigation
(HSI) and Prove It! Participants were selected through a qualifying process
that evaluated the quality of their Secondary Two History cohort's Historical
Investigation projects. They wrote an essay and created an engaging video
exploring the importance of using digital devices wisely, utilizing credible
research sources. The students also shared tips during school assembly
on evaluating online sources using the S.U.R.E. framework.</p>
<p>Two teams participated in each competition, achieving remarkable results:</p>

<p>The HSI and Prove It! competitions are annual events organized by the
National Library Board that enable students to develop their communication,
research, and presentation skills. Our students represented the school
with distinction, and we believe their accomplishments will inspire more
students to participate in humanities-related events and activities. Congratulations,
CANberrans!</p>
