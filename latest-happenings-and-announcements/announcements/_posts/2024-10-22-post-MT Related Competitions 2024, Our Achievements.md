<p>This year, our students' active participation in various Mother Tongue-related
competitions and events showcased their dedication and passion for their
cultural heritage. They took part in prestigious contests like the National
Chinese Challenge, the 7th National Text Recital Competition, the 2024
Chinese Street Dance Competition. Students offering Tamil Language also
represented our school in the Word for Word Contest, organized by the Association
of Singapore Tamil Writers. These achievements reflect not just our students'
language abilities, but their courage to step out of their comfort zone.</p>

<p>These platforms allowed students to go beyond traditional classroom learning,
applying the knowledge gained from textbooks in creative and exciting ways.
From language skills to artistic expression through dance and performance,
our students discovered that learning a Mother Tongue is a dynamic journey.
It is about expressing culture, building confidence, and connecting with
peers from other schools.</p>

<p>On 1st October, our Principal, Mr. Leong, acknowledged the students' outstanding
efforts by presenting them with certificates during the morning assembly.
He not only congratulated them on their achievements but also encouraged
them to continue nurturing their love for their Mother Tongue. Mr. Leong's
inspiring words urged students to seize new opportunities for growth and
apply their language skills in meaningful and practical ways.</p>

<p>These enriching experiences highlight the importance of learning through
practice. As students immerse themselves in the diverse aspects of their
Mother Tongue, they discover that true knowledge goes beyond vocabulary,
sentences, or writingâ€”it is an ongoing journey of self-expression, collaboration,
and cultural pride. After all, each competition our students participate
in builds a stronger connection to their cultural roots.</p>
