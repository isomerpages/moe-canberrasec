<p>Our robotics program has achieved remarkable success in recent competitions,
demonstrating the extraordinary talent and dedication of our students.</p>
<p>In their competitive debut at the Newcomer Meets at ACS(I), our junior
team secured a prestigious top 8 position, advancing to the quarterfinals.
This achievement set the stage for even greater accomplishments to come.</p>
<p>Building on this momentum, our students participated in the Singapore
VEX V5 RC Open Tournament 2024, competing against 49 teams from Hong Kong,
Thailand, and Singapore. Once again, our team reached the top 8 and earned
the distinguished Judges' Award, showcasing their exceptional abilities
on an international stage.</p>
<p>What makes these achievements particularly noteworthy is that our students
only began their journey with VEX robotics in late June. Their rapid progress
reflects countless hours of additional training, remarkable teamwork, and
innovative problem-solving approaches.</p>
