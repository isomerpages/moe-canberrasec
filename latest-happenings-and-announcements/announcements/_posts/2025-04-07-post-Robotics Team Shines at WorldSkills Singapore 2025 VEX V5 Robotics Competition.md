<p>We are proud to share the achievements of our Robotics Club at the WorldSkills
VEX V5 Robotics Competition, held on 3 April 2025 at the Sands Expo &amp;
Convention Centre. Representing Canberra Secondary School, two of our teams
competed alongside top schools such as Nan Hua High School, ACS(I), and
School of Science and Technology (SST)—and returned with three prestigious
awards:</p>
<p><strong>Create Award</strong> – Recognising the team’s innovative engineering
design and creative problem-solving approaches in accomplishing game objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Amaze Award</strong> – Acknowledging consistent high performance
and competitiveness through both driving skills and autonomous programming.</p>
<p><strong>Finalist Award</strong> – For finishing second overall in the tournament
after an intense and closely fought final round.</p>

<p>From the moment our students entered the venue, they demonstrated teamwork,
precision, and resilience. Our 2769C team, made up of Secondary 1 and 3
students, ranked 2nd in the qualifiers—a first for our school—earning them
the right to choose their alliance. Their hard work paid off as they advanced
to the finals and delivered an outstanding performance alongside their
alliance partner.</p>
<p>Though they narrowly missed the championship title in the last match,
their journey was nothing short of inspirational. Meanwhile, our 2769B
team showed grit and determination, rebuilding their drivetrain mid-event
in preparation for future competitions.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, our students exemplified the values of perseverance,
teamwork, communication, and sportsmanship. Even the head referee remarked,
“Canberrans are indeed a formidable team.”</p>
<p>We may have come close, but this is just the beginning. With lessons learned
and renewed determination, our Canberrans are ready to come back stronger.
Watch out for Team 2769—the journey to the championship continues!</p>
