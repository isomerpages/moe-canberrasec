<p>We celebrate Badminton C Boys Captain, Hariharan s/o Alagappan of 2 Resilience,
for his outstanding display of sportsmanship. During the 3rd/4th Placing
Match of the National League 2 Badminton Competition on 22 August 2025
against Evergreen Secondary School, this exceptional Canberran impressed
both their Principal and teachers-in-charge with his grit, skill, and integrity.
In a crucial rally, the umpire had awarded him a point, but Hariharan immediately
corrected the call, declaring the shuttle out. By placing fairness and
honesty above personal and team advantage, he left a lasting impression
on the opposing school and match officials. His actions truly embody the
spirit of sportâ€”honesty, integrity, and respect for the game.</p>
<p>Hariharan's exemplary conduct serves as an inspiration to all our Canberran
athletes. Remember that true victory lies not just in winning, but in how
you compete. Our character as athletes speaks louder than any trophy or
medal. To all our current and future sports representatives: strive to
compete with the same honor and sportsmanship that makes our school proud,
both in victory and defeat.</p>
