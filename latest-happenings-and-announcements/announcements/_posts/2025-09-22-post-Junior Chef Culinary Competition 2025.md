<p>At Republic Polytechnic's Junior Chef Culinary Competition, finalists
from top schools showcased their culinary artistry. Xanneth and Afie from
Sec 3 Respect proudly represented Canberra Secondary, crafting their innovative
take on the Awesome Pedas burger. While they didn't place in the top three,
these aspiring chefs gained invaluable experience working in an industrial-standard
kitchen. We applaud their creativity and determination in this competitive
culinary arena.</p>
<p>Xanneth and Afie show us that every experience is a stepping stone to
growth. To all Canberrans with creative passions: pursue what excites you,
even if the outcome is uncertain. Whether it's cooking, art, music, or
any other pursuit, the courage to try and the willingness to learn matter
more than winning. Your creativity and determination today build the foundation
for tomorrow's success.</p>
