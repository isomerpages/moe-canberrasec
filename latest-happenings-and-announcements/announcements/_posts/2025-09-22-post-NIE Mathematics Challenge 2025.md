<p>The NIE Mathematics Challenge is an annual competition organised by the
National Institute of Education, designed to stretch mathematical thinking
through non-routine problems that go beyond the school curriculum. The
challenge encourages creativity, logical reasoning, and perseverance in
problem-solving. Several of our students rose to this challenge, with a
number achieving High Distinction and Distinction Awards.</p>
<p>Well done Canberrans, for your exceptional mathematical prowess. To all
our budding mathematicians: don't shy away from challenging problems that
seem impossible at first glance. Every complex equation you tackle, every
creative solution you discover, strengthens your analytical thinking. Mathematics
is not just about getting the right answerâ€”it's about developing the resilience
to keep trying when the path isn't clear.</p>
