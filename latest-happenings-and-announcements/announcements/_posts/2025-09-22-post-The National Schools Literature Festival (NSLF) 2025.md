<p>The National Schools Literature Festival provides a vibrant platform for
developing students' passion for literature, collaboratively organized
by educators with support from the Ministry of Education, National Institute
of Education, National Arts Council and Singapore Book Council.</p>
<p>Our budding writers and literature enthusiasts embraced this opportunity
with gusto. Canberrans submitted Flash Fictions exploring the theme "60",
while our lower secondary cohort created compelling Book Trailers and Upper
Secondary Literature students engaged in spirited Unseen Debates. We honor
all participants for their literary passion and creative expression!</p>
<p>To all Canberrans who love words and stories: never underestimate the
power of your voice. Every story you write, every book you discuss, every
creative idea you share contributes to our rich literary community. Literature
teaches us empathy, critical thinking, and the art of expressionâ€”skills
that will serve you in every aspect of life.</p>
