<p><strong>About the World Robot Games</strong>
</p>
<p>The World Robot Games is an international robotics competition that brings
together young innovators, educators, and technology enthusiasts from around
the globe. Designed to promote STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
Arts, and Mathematics) learning, WRG challenges participants to apply their
creativity, problem-solving skills, and teamwork in a variety of hands-on
robot games.</p>

workshops, testing opportunities, and competitions, culminating in an awarding
ceremony to celebrate participants' achievements.</p>
