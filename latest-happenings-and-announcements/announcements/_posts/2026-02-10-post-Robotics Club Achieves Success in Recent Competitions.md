<p>We are thrilled to share the achievements of our school robotics club
in recent VEX V5 competitions.
<br>
<br>At the Singapore Spooky Robo Rumble (V5RC), Team 2769B was awarded the
Inspire Award. The<strong> </strong>Inspire Award<strong> </strong>recognises
passion for the competition and positivity at the event. Our students maintained
integrity and goodwill toward other teams, even when the odds were against
them.</p>
<p>We followed this up with the Sportsmanship Award at the Singapore VEX
V5RC Tournament 2025, won by Team 2769D. The Sportsmanship Award recognises
a high degree of good sportsmanship, helpfulness, respect, and a positive
attitude both on and off the competition field.</p>
<p>We are incredibly proud of their achievements and look forward to supporting
them in future competitions</p>
